abstract = {While photon-pair sources using silicon waveguides have shown great promise, strong two-photon absorption (TPA) may limit their brightness. Recently, high-index contrast doped glass (HICDG) has attracted attention because of its CMOS compatibility and low propagation loss. It is also expected that TPA in HICDG is small, though it has not yet been directly measured by conventionally used CW pumping. In this paper, we report that the estimated genuine coincidence events by photon-pairs increase quadratically as the pump power increased and do not show any saturation behavior up to 100 mW CW pump power.},

abstract = {It is a fundamental challenge in quantum optics to deterministically generate indistinguishable single photons through non-deterministic nonlinear optical processes, due to the intrinsic coupling of single-and multi-photon-generation probabilities in these processes. Actively multiplexing photons generated in many temporal modes can decouple these probabilities, but key issues are to minimize resource requirements to allow scalability, and to ensure indistinguishability of the generated photons. Here we demonstrate the multiplexing of photons from four temporal modes solely using fibre-integrated optics and off-the-shelf electronic components. We show a 100{\%} enhancement to the single-photon output probability without introducing additional multi-photon noise. Photon indistinguishability is confirmed by a fourfold Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference with a 91Â±16{\%} visibility after subtracting multi-photon noise due to high pump power. Our demonstration paves the way for scalable multiplexing of many non-deterministic photon sources to a single near-deterministic source, which will be of benefit to future quantum photonic technologies.},

abstract = {Quantum frequency conversion (QFC), a nonlinear optical process in which the frequency of a quantum light field is altered while conserving its non-classical correlations, was first demonstrated 20 years ago. Meanwhile, it is considered an essential tool for the implementation of quantum repeaters since it allows for interfacing quantum memories with telecom-wavelength photons as quantum information carriers. Here we demonstrate efficient ({\textgreater}30{\%}) QFC of visible single photons (711 nm) emitted by a quantum dot (QD) to a telecom wavelength (1,313 nm). Analysis of the first and second-order coherence before and after wavelength conversion clearly proves that important properties, such as the coherence time and photon antibunching, are fully conserved during the frequency translation process. Our findings underline the great potential of single photon sources on demand in combination with QFC as a promising technique for quantum repeater schemes.},

However, the frequency bands for optimal transmission and storage of photons are often not the same. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the coherent frequency conversion of photons entangled in their polarization, a widely used degree of freedom in photonic quantum information processing. We verify the successful entanglement conversion by violating a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality and fully characterize our near-perfect entanglement transfer using both state and process tomography.

abstract = {Electro-optic modulation, the imprinting of a radio-frequency (RF) waveform on an optical carrier, is one of the most important photonics functions, being crucial for high-bandwidth signal generation, optical switching, waveform shaping, data communications, ultrafast measurements, sampling, timing and ranging, and RF photonics. Although silicon (Si) photonic electro-optic modulators (EOMs) can be fabricated using wafer-scale technology compatible with the semiconductor industry, such devices do not exceed an electrical 3-dB bandwidth of about 50 GHz, whereas many applications require higher RF frequencies. Bulk Lithium Niobate (LN) and etched LN modulators can scale to higher bandwidths, but are not integrated with the Si photonics fabrication process adopted widely over the last decade. As an alternative, an ultra-high-bandwidth Mach-Zehnder EOM based on Si photonics is shown, made using conventional lithography and wafer-scale fabrication, bonded to an unpatterned LN thin film. This hybrid LN-Si MZM achieves beyond 100 GHz 3-dB electrical bandwidth. Our design integrates silicon photonics light input/output and optical components, including directional couplers, low-radius bends, and path-length difference segments, realized in a foundry Si photonics process. The use of a simple low-temperature (200C) back-end integration process to bond a postage-stamp-sized piece of LN where desired, and achieving light routing into and out of LN to harness its electro-optic property without any etching or patterning of the LN film, may be broadly-useful strategies for advanced integrated opto-electronic microchips.},

These devices, when combined with integrated single photon detectors, satisfy the requirements at each of the levels of future QKD networks --- from point-of-use through to backbone --- and open the way to operation in existing and emerging classical communication networks.},

Such miniaturized spectrometers would greatly enable applications in chemistry, bio-medicine, material science or space instrumentation, such as hyperspectral microscopy of live cells or pharmaceutical quality control. Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS), a recent technique of Fourier transform spectroscopy without moving parts, is particularly promising since it measures high-precision spectra in the gas phase using only a single detector. Here, we present a microresonator-based platform designed for mid-infrared (mid-IR) DCS.

Thermal control and free-carrier injection control modelocking of each comb and tune the dual-comb parameters. The large line spacing of the combs (127 GHz) and its precise tuning over tens of MHz, unique features of chip-scale comb generators, are exploited for a proof-of-principle experiment of vibrational absorption DCS in the liquid phase, with spectra of acetone spanning from 2870 nm to 3170 nm at 127-GHz (4.2-cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) resolution. We take a significant step towards a broadband, mid-IR spectroscopy instrument on a chip.

abstract = {Quantum repeaters are critical components for distributing entanglement over long distances in presence of unavoidable optical losses during transmission. Stimulated by Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller protocol, many improved quantum-repeater protocols based on quantum memories have been proposed, which commonly focus on the entanglement-distribution rate. Among these protocols, the elimination of multi-photons (multi-photon-pairs) and the use of multimode quantum memory are demonstrated to have the ability to greatly improve the entanglement-distribution rate. Here, we demonstrate the storage of deterministic single photons emitted from a quantum dot in a polarization-maintaining solid-state quantum memory; in addition, multi-temporal-mode memory with {\$}1{\$}, {\$}20{\$} and {\$}100{\$} narrow single-photon pulses is also demonstrated. Multi-photons are eliminated, and only one photon at most is contained in each pulse. Moreover, the solid-state properties of both sub-systems make this configuration more stable and easier to be scalable. Our work will be helpful in the construction of efficient quantum repeaters based on all-solid-state devices},

abstract = {Optical nonlinearity has been widely used to try to produce optical isolators. However, this is very difficult to achieve due to dynamical reciprocity. Here, we show the use of the chiral cross-Kerr nonlinearity of atoms at room temperature to realize optical isolation, circumventing dynamical reciprocity. In our approach, the chiral cross-Kerr nonlinearity is induced by the thermal motion of N-type atoms. The resulting cross phase shift and absorption of a weak probe field are dependent on its propagation direction. This proposed optical isolator can achieve more than 30 dB of isolation ratio, with a low loss of less than 1 dB. By inserting this atomic medium in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we further propose a four-port optical circulator with a fidelity larger than 0.9 and an average insertion loss less than 1.6 dB. Using atomic vapor embedded in an on-chip waveguide, our method may provide chip-compatible optical isolation at the single-photon level of a probe field.},

By lever- aging silicon-chip photonics for integration and to reduce component size and complexity, we demonstrate a compact optical-clock architecture. Here a semiconductor laser is stabilized to an optical transition in a microfabricated rubid- ium vapor cell, and a pair ofinterlocked Kerr-microresonator frequency combs provide fully coherent optical division of the clock laser to generate an electronic 22 GHz clock signal with a fractional frequency instability of one part in 1013.

The $\alpha$-factor leader consists of a 19-amino acid N-terminal pre or signal sequence followed by a 66-amino acid proregion. After removal of the signal sequence during membrane translocation, the proregion is cleaved from the precursor protein by the Kex2 endoprotease only in a late Golgi compartment. Here we report that a modified Kex2 enzyme, containing at the C-terminus the HDEL tetrapeptide, cleaves the proregion from the $\alpha$-factor leader-human insulin like growth factor-1 fusion protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. The processing of pro-proteins earlier in the secretion pathway could be helpful in defining the cellular function of the proregions present naturally in various eucaryotic precursor proteins. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The use of special quantum states to achieve sensitivities below the limits established by classically behaving states has enjoyed immense success since its inception. In bosonic interferometers, squeezed states, number states and cat states have been implemented on various platforms and have demonstrated improved measurement precision over interferometers based on coherent states. Another metrologically useful state is an equal superposition of two eigenstates with maximally different energies; this state ideally reaches the full interferometric sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics. By leveraging improvements to our apparatus made primarily to reach higher operation fidelities in quantum information processing, we extend a technique to create number states up to {\$}n=100{\$} and to generate superpositions of a harmonic oscillator ground state and a number state of the form {\$}\backslashtextstyle{\{}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}\backslashsqrt{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\}}(\backslashlvert 0\backslashrangle+\backslashlvert n\backslashrangle){\$} with {\$}n{\$} up to 18 in the motion of a single trapped ion. While experimental imperfections prevent us from reaching the ideal Heisenberg limit, we observe enhanced sensitivity to changes in the oscillator frequency that initially increases linearly with {\$}n{\$}, with maximal value at {\$}n=12{\$} where we observe 3.2(2) dB higher sensitivity compared to an ideal measurement on a coherent state with the same average occupation number. The quantum advantage from using number-state superpositions can be leveraged towards precision measurements on any harmonic oscillator system; here it enables us to track the average fractional frequency of oscillation of a single trapped ion to approximately 2.6 {\$}\backslashtimes{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}{\$} in 5 s. Such measurements should provide improved characterization of imperfections and noise on trapping potentials, which can lead to motional decoherence, a leading source of error in quantum information processing with trapped ions.},

abstract = {Optical laser fields have been widely used to achieve quantum control over the motional and internal degrees of freedom of atoms and ions, molecules and atomic gases. A route to controlling the quantum states of macroscopic mechanical oscillators in a similar fashion is to exploit the parametric coupling between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom through radiation pressure in suitably engineered optical cavities. If the optomechanical coupling is quantum coherent-that is, if the coherent coupling rate exceeds both the optical and the mechanical decoherence rate-quantum states are transferred from the optical field to the mechanical oscillator and vice versa. This transfer allows control of the mechanical oscillator state using the wide range of available quantum optical techniques. So far, however, quantum-coherent coupling of micromechanical oscillators has only been achieved using microwave fields at millikelvin temperatures. Optical experiments have not attained this regime owing to the large mechanical decoherence rates and the difficulty of overcoming optical dissipation. Here we achieve quantum-coherent coupling between optical photons and a micromechanical oscillator. Simultaneously, coupling to the cold photon bath cools the mechanical oscillator to an average occupancy of 1.7-Â° Â±-0.1 motional quanta. Excitation with weak classical light pulses reveals the exchange of energy between the optical light field and the micromechanical oscillator in the time domain at the level of less than one quantum on average. This optomechanical system establishes an efficient quantum interface between mechanical oscillators and optical photons, which can provide decoherence-free transport of quantum states through optical fibres. Our results offer a route towards the use of mechanical oscillators as quantum transducers or in microwave-to-optical quantum links. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Operated at the fundamental limit where a single quantum of light or matter controls another field or material system, it may enable fascinating applications such as long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum information processing and metrology, and the exploration of novel quantum states of matter. Here, by strongly coupling a photon to a single atom trapped in the near field of a nanoscale photonic crystal cavity, we realize a system where a single atom switches the phase of a photon, and a single photon modifies the atom's phase. We experimentally demonstrate an atom-induced optical phase shift that is nonlinear at the two-photon level, a photon number router that separates individual photons and photon pairs into different output modes, and a single-photon switch where a single "gate" photon controls the propagation of a subsequent probe field. These techniques pave the way towards integrated quantum nanophotonic networks involving multiple atomic nodes connected by guided light.},

The single fundamental mode propagation was confirmed by several techniques that reveal no signature of higher-order mode excitation. It can be, therefore, concluded that adiabatic tapering is a powerful method for selective excitation of the fundamental mode in highly multimode large-mode-area fibers. Annular near field distortion observed for large output core diameters was attributed to built-in stress due to thermal expansion mismatch between core and cladding materials. The mechanical stress could be avoided by an appropriate technique of fiber preform fabrication and drawing, which would prevent the mode field deformation and lead to reliable diffraction-limited fundamental mode guiding for very large core diameters.},

abstract = {The hybridization of distinct quantum systems has opened new avenues to exploit the best properties of these individual systems. Superconducting circuits and electron spin ensembles are one such example. Strong coupling and the coherent transfer and storage of quantum information has been achieved with nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond. Recently, we have observed a remarkably sharp resonance (â¼1 MHz) at 2.878 GHz in the spectrum of flux qubit negatively charged nitrogen vacancy diamond hybrid quantum system under zero external magnetic field. This width is much narrower than that of both the flux qubit and spin ensemble. Here we show that this resonance is evidence of a collective dark state in the ensemble, which is coherently driven by the superposition of clockwise and counter-clockwise macroscopic persistent supercurrents flowing in the flux qubit. The collective dark state is a unique physical system and could provide a long-lived quantum memory.},

abstract = {Strong-field effects in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas and high intensity laser and cavity systems are considered, related to quantum electrodynamical (QED) photon-photon scattering. Current state-of-the-art laser facilities are close to reaching energy scales at which laboratory astrophysics will become possible. In such high energy density laboratory astrophysical systems, quantum electrodynamics will play a crucial role in the dynamics of plasmas and indeed the vacuum itself. Developments such as the free-electron laser may also give a means for exploring remote violent events such as supernovae in a laboratory environment. At the same time, superconducting cavities have steadily increased their quality factors, and quantum nondemolition measurements are capable of retrieving information from systems consisting of a few photons. Thus, not only will QED effects such as elastic photon-photon scattering be important in laboratory experiments, it may also be directly measurable in cavity experiments. Here implications of collective interactions between photons and photon-plasma systems are described. An overview of strong field vacuum effects is given, as formulated through the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian. Based on the dispersion relation for a single test photon traveling in a slowly varying background electromagnetic field, a set of equations describing the nonlinear propagation of an electromagnetic pulse on a radiation plasma is derived. The stability of the governing equations is discussed, and it is shown using numerical methods that electromagnetic pulses may collapse and split into pulse trains, as well as be trapped in a relativistic electron hole. Effects, such as the generation of novel electromagnetic modes, introduced by QED in pair plasmas is described. Applications to laser-plasma systems and astrophysical environments are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We derive a spatiotemporal equation describing nonlinear optical dynamics in Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities containing a Kerr medium. This equation is an extension of the equation that describes dynamics in Kerr-nonlinear ring resonators, referred to as the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) due to its formulation by Lugiato and Lefever in 1987. We use the new equation to study the properties of Kerr frequency combs in FP resonators. The derivation of the equation starts from the set of Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the dynamics of the forward and backward propagating envelopes of the electric field coupled to the atomic polarization and population difference variables in a FP cavity. The final equation is formulated in terms of an auxiliary field {\$}\backslashpsi(z,t){\$} that evolves over a slow time {\$}t{\$} on the domain {\$}-L \backslashleq z \backslashleq L{\$} with periodic boundary conditions, where {\$}L{\$} is the cavity length. We describe how the forward and backward propagating field envelopes are obtained after solving the equation for {\$}\backslashpsi{\$}. This formulation makes the comparison between the FP and ring geometries straightforward. The FP equation includes an additional nonlinear term relative to the LLE for the ring cavity, with the effect that the value of the detuning parameter {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} of the ring LLE is increased by twice the average of {\$}|\backslashpsi|{\^{}}2{\$}. This feature establishes a connection between the stationary phenomena in the two geometries. For the FP-LLE, we discuss the linear stability analysis of the flat stationary solutions, analytic approximations of solitons, Turing patterns, and nonstationary patterns. We note that Turing patterns with different numbers of rolls may exist for the same values of the system parameters. We then discuss some implications of the nonlinear integral term in the FP-LLE for the kind of experiments which have been conducted in Kerr-nonlinear ring resonators.},

abstract = {Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, the fact that identical photons that arrive simultaneously on different input ports of a beam splitter bunch into a common output port, can be used to measure optical delays between different paths. It is generally assumed that great precision in the measurement requires that photons contain many frequencies, i.e., a large bandwidth. Here we challenge this well-known assumption and show that the use of two well-separated frequencies embedded in a quantum entangled state (discrete color entanglement) suffices to achieve great precision. We determine optimum working points using a Fisher Information analysis and demonstrate the experimental feasibility of this approach by detecting thermally-induced delays in an optical fiber. These results will not only prove useful for facilitating the use of quantum interference for quantum sensing, by avoiding some stringent conditions such as the requirement for large bandwidth signals, but also indicate new directions towards harnessing multi-photon interference in general.},

In this review, we provide a unified theoretical platform that not only can be used for understanding the underlying physics but should also provide guidance toward new and useful applications. We begin with a description of the third-order nonlinearity of silicon and consider the tensorial nature of both the electronic and Raman contributions. The generation of free carriers through two-photon absorption and their impact on various nonlinear phenomena is included fully within the theory presented here. We derive a general propagation equation in the frequency domain and show how it leads to a generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation when it is converted to the time domain. We use this equation to study propagation of ultrashort optical pulses in the presence of self-phase modulation and show the possibility of soliton formation and supercontinuum generation. The nonlinear phenomena of cross-phase modulation and stimulated Raman scattering are discussed next with emphasis on the impact of free carriers on Raman amplification and lasing. We also consider the four-wave mixing process for both continuous-wave and pulsed pumping and discuss the conditions under which parametric amplification and wavelength conversion can be realized with net gain in the telecommunication band.},

We report here on the fabrication and testing of annealing-free SiNOI nonlinear photonic circuits.

In combination with density functional theory calculations, the present experimental electron-density distribution of the $\alpha$-Si3N 4 indicates covalent bonds between Si and N atoms and charge transfer from the Si to N atom. The triangular distribution around the N atoms, which is attributable to the nitrogen sp2 hybridization for the nearest silicon and nitrogen pairs, was found in both experimental and theoretical electron density distributions. The minimum electron density in an intralayer Si-N bond was a little lower than that in an interlayer bond, which would be responsible for the inequality between elastic constants, C33 {\textgreater} C11.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. An optical modulator integrated on silicon is a key enabler for high-performance optical interconnects. However, Si-based optical modulators suffer from low phase-modulation efficiency owing to the weak plasma dispersion effect in Si, which also results in large optical loss. Therefore, it is essential to find a novel modulation scheme for Si photonics. Here, we demonstrate an InGaAsP/Si hybrid metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) optical modulator formed by direct wafer bonding. Electron accumulation at the InGaAsP MOS interface enables the utilization of the electron-induced refractive index change in InGaAsP, which is significantly greater than that in Si (refs 9,10). The presented modulator exhibits a phase-modulation efficiency of 0.047 Vcm and low optical attenuation of 0.23 dB at $\pi$ phase shift at 1.55 $\mu$m wavelength, which are approximately 5 times higher and 10 times lower than Si MOS optical modulators, respectively. This approach provides a new, high-performance phase-modulation scheme for Si photonics.},

abstract = {Optical frequency combs provide equidistant frequency markers in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet, and can be used to link an unknown optical frequency to a radio or microwave frequency reference. Since their inception, frequency combs have triggered substantial advances in optical frequency metrology and precision measurements and in applications such as broadband laser-based gas sensing and molecular fingerprinting. Early work generated frequency combs by intra-cavity phase modulation; subsequently, frequency combs have been generated using the comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized. Here we report a substantially different approach to comb generation, in which equally spaced frequency markers are produced by the interaction between a continuous-wave pump laser of a known frequency with the modes of a monolithic ultra-high-Q microresonator via the Kerr nonlinearity. The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain makes it possible to generate discrete comb modes over a 500-nm-wide span (â¼70 THz) around 1,550 nm without relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based measurements reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb, overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3 Ã 10 -18. In contrast to femtosecond mode-locked lasers, this work represents a step towards a monolithic optical frequency comb generator, allowing considerable reduction in size, complexity and power consumption. Moreover, the approach can operate at previously unattainable repetition rates, exceeding 100 GHz, which are useful in applications where access to individual comb modes is required, such as optical waveform synthesis, high capacity telecommunications or astrophysical spectrometer calibration. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Control over physical systems at the quantum level is a goal shared by scientists in fields as diverse as metrology, information processing, simulation and chemistry. For trapped atomic ions, the quantized motional and internal degrees of freedom can be coherently manipulated with laser light. Similar control is difficult to achieve with radio frequency or microwave radiation because the essential coupling between internal degrees of freedom and motion requires significant field changes over the extent of the atoms' motion. The field gradients are negligible at these frequencies for freely propagating fields; however, stronger gradients can be generated in the near-field of microwave currents in structures smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the experiments reported here, we coherently manipulate the internal quantum states of the ions on time scales of 20 ns. We also generate entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom of two atoms with a gate operation suitable for general quantum computation. We implement both operations through the magnetic fields from microwave currents in electrodes that are integrated into the micro-fabricated trap structure and create an entangled state with fidelity 76(3) {\%}. This approach, where the quantum control mechanism is integrated into the trapping device in a scalable manner, can potentially benefit quantum information processing, simulation and spectroscopy.},

Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong nonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and proposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to modern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the last two decades. In a similar fashion, here we use the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light via engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our results demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal device, fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon (Si). At low temperature (8.7 K), we show an optically-tunable delay of 50 ns with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microseconds signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory, are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature and in the analogous regime of Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.},

The principle of the coherent manipulation process is analyzed theoretically and demonstrated by experiments of nonclassical two-photon interference under different phase differences between the two arms in the UMZI, showing a fringe visibility of (96.9 Â± 1.0){\%}. The frequency-entangled two-photon state can be prepared under a proper phase difference, which is demonstrated by an experiment of spatial quantum beating with a fitting visibility of (99.0 Â± 0.8){\%}. The proposed scheme provides a simple and general way to prepare frequency-entangled states from the frequency nondegenerate energy-time entangled state, which can be easily realized through setups based on fiber optics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Optical Society of America.},

This progress has been possible thanks to materials development of Si quantum devices, and the physical understanding of quantum effects in silicon. Recent critical steps include the isolation of single electrons, the observation of spin blockade, and single-shot readout of individual electron spins in both dopants and gated quantum dots in Si.

abstract = {A microscopic quantum system under continuous observation exhibits at random times sudden jumps between its states. The detection of this quantum feature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement repeated many times during the system's evolution. Whereas quantum jumps of trapped massive particles (electrons, ions or molecules) have been observed, this has proved more challenging for light quanta. Standard photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to detect the same photon twice. It is therefore necessary to use a transparent counter that can 'see' photons without destroying them. Moreover, the light needs to be stored for durations much longer than the QND detection time. Here we report an experiment in which we fulfil these challenging conditions and observe quantum jumps in the photon number. Microwave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times up to half a second, and are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An atom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the non-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the presence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms, highly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden state switchings. These telegraphic signals record the birth, life and death of individual photons. Applying a similar QND procedure to mesoscopic fields with tens of photons should open new perspectives for the exploration of the quantum-to-classical boundary.},

In analogy to double-slit diffraction, the resulting interference generates high-contrast frequency structure in the qubit-phonon interaction. We observe this frequency structure both in the coupling rate to multiple cavity modes and in the qubit spontaneous emission rate into unconfined modes. We use this sharp frequency structure to resolve single phonons by tuning the qubit to a frequency of destructive interference where all acoustic interactions are dispersive. By exciting several detuned yet strongly coupled phononic modes and measuring the resulting qubit spectrum, we observe that, for two modes, the device enters the strong dispersive regime where single phonons are spectrally resolved.},

We explain the experimentally feasible creation of various classes of multiphoton entanglement encoded in polarization as well as in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces -- starting only from non-entangled photon pairs. For two photons, arbitrary high-dimensional entanglement can be created. The idea of generating entanglement by path identity could also apply to other quantum entities than photons.

One of the most commonly used light source for SD-OCT is based on superluminescent diodes (SLD), which provide a low-noise broadband coverage. Recent advances have allowed creating photonic integrated chipscale frequency combs, that provide an attractive alternative illumination scheme for SD-OCT. Yet to date, the use of such soliton micro-combs in OCT has not been demonstrated or considered. Here we explore the use of soliton microcombs in spectral domain OCT. By using photonic chipscale {\$}Si{\_}3N{\_}4{\$} resonators in conjunction with 1300 nm pump lasers, we show that spectral bandwidths that exceed those of commercial SLDs are possible. By comparing SD-OCT imaging on an ex vivo fixed mouse brain tissue using soliton microcombs as well as an SLD, we demonstrate the principle viability of this novel light source. Altogether, the improvements and implications enabled by the discrete nature and the extremely high temporal coherence of the micro-comb are discussed, including enhancement of sensitivity roll-off using k-space imaging, optical-domain sub-sampling for high-efficiency imaging, and the possibility for further miniaturization of the OCT setup.},

abstract = {Optical frequency combs have revolutionized the field of frequency metrology within the last decade and have become enabling tools for atomic clocks, gas sensing and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. The rapidly increasing number of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators. Optical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard. Critical to their future use as 'frequency markers', is however the absolute frequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum. A powerful technique for this stabilization is self-referencing, which requires a spectrum that spans a full octave, i.e. a factor of two in frequency. In the case of mode locked lasers, overcoming the limited bandwidth has become possible only with the advent of photonic crystal fibres for supercontinuum generation. Here, we report for the first time the generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb directly from a toroidal microresonator on a silicon chip. The comb spectrum covers the wavelength range from 990 nm to 2170 nm and is retrieved from a continuous wave laser interacting with the modes of an ultra high Q microresonator, without relying on external broadening. Full tunability of the generated frequency comb over a bandwidth exceeding an entire free spectral range is demonstrated. This allows positioning of a frequency comb mode to any desired frequency within the comb bandwidth. The ability to derive octave spanning spectra from microresonator comb generators represents a key step towards achieving a radio-frequency to optical link on a chip, which could unify the fields of metrology with micro- and nano-photonics and enable entirely new devices that bring frequency metrology into a chip scale setting for compact applications such as space based optical clocks.},

In contrast to many conventional PDC sources, BRWs are made of high refractive index materials and their characteristics are very sensitive to the underlying layer structure. First, we show that the design parameters like the phasematching wavelength and the group refractive indices of the interacting modes can be reliably controlled even in the presence of fabrication tolerances. We then investigate, how these characteristics can be taken advantage of when designing quantum photonic applications with BRWs. We especially concentrate on achieving a small differential group delay between the generated photons of a pair and then explore the performance of our design when realizing a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference experiment or generating spectrally multi-band polarization entangled states. Our results show that the versatility provided by engineering the dispersion in BRWs is important for employing them in different quantum optics tasks.},

abstract = {Mechanical systems facilitate the development of a new generation of hybrid quantum technology comprising electrical, optical, atomic and acoustic degrees of freedom. Entanglement is the essential resource that defines this new paradigm of quantum enabled devices. Continuous variable (CV) entangled fields, known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, are spatially separated two-mode squeezed states that can be used to implement quantum teleportation and quantum communication. In the optical domain, EPR states are typically generated using nondegenerate optical amplifiers and at microwave frequencies Josephson circuits can serve as a nonlinear medium. It is an outstanding goal to deterministically generate and distribute entangled states with a mechanical oscillator. Here we observe stationary emission of path-entangled microwave radiation from a parametrically driven 30 micrometer long silicon nanostring oscillator, squeezing the joint field operators of two thermal modes by 3.40(37) dB below the vacuum level. This mechanical system correlates up to 50 photons/s/Hz giving rise to a quantum discord that is robust with respect to microwave noise. Such generalized quantum correlations of separable states are important for quantum enhanced detection and provide direct evidence for the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator without directly measuring its state. This noninvasive measurement scheme allows to infer information about otherwise inaccessible objects with potential implications in sensing, open system dynamics and fundamental tests of quantum gravity. In the near future, similar on-chip devices can be used to entangle subsystems on vastly different energy scales such as microwave and optical photons.},

abstract = {High-dimensional encoding of quantum information provides a way of transcending the limitations of current approaches to quantum communication, which are mostly based on the entanglement between qubitsâtwo-dimensional quantum systems. One of the central challenges in the pursuit of high-dimensional alternatives is ascertaining the presence of high-dimensional entanglement within a given high-dimensional quantum state. In particular, it would be desirable to carry out such entanglement certification without resorting to inefficient full state tomography. Here, we show how carefully constructed measurements in two bases (one of which is not orthonormal) can be used to faithfully and efficiently certify bipartite high-dimensional states and their entanglement for any physical platform. To showcase the practicality of this approach under realistic conditions, we put it to the test for photons entangled in their orbital angular momentum. In our experimental set-up, we are able to verify 9-dimensional entanglement for a pair of photons on a 11-dimensional subspace each, at present the highest amount certified without any assumptions on the state.},

Despite the numerous applications, integrated lasers currently suffer from large linewidth. Brillouin lasers, with their unique properties, offer an intriguing solution, yet bringing their performance to integrated platforms has remained elusive.

This silicon-foundry-compatible design supports low loss from 405 to 2,350 nm and can be integrated with other components.

abstract = {Selective on-chip optical filters with high rejection levels are key components for a wide range of advanced photonic circuits. However, maximum achievable rejection in state-of-the-art on-chip devices is seriously limited by phase errors arising from fabrication imperfections. Due to coherent interactions, unwanted phase-shifts result in detrimental destructive interferences that distort the filter response, whatever the chosen strategy (resonators, interferometers, Bragg filters, etc.). Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a radically different approach to overcome this fundamental limitation, based on coherency-broken Bragg filters. We exploit non-coherent interaction among modal-engineered waveguide Bragg gratings separated by single-mode waveguides to yield effective cascading, even in the presence of fabrication errors. This technologically independent approach allows seamless combination of filter stages with moderate performance, providing a dramatic increase of on-chip rejection. Based on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate on-chip non-coherent cascading of Si Bragg filters with a record light rejection exceeding 80 dB in the C-band.},

Our network architecture thus minimizes the resources required of each user without sacrificing security or functionality. As no adaptations of the source are required to add users, the network can readily be scaled to a large number of clients, whereby no trust in the provider of the quantum source is required. Unlike previous attempts at multi-user networks, which have been based on active components, and thus limited to some duty cycle, our implementation is fully passive and thus provides the potential for unprecedented quantum communication speeds. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a single source of bi-partite polarization entanglement which is multiplexed into 12 wavelength channels to distribute 6 states between 4 users in a fully connected graph using only 1 fiber and polarization analysis module per user.},

abstract = {Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) enable miniaturization of optical quantum circuits because several optic and electronic functionalities can be added on the same chip. Single photon emitters (SPEs) are central building blocks for such quantum circuits and several approaches have been developed to interface PICs with a host material containing SPEs. SPEs embedded in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides have unique properties that make them particularly appealing as PIC-integrated SPEs. They can be easily interfaced with PICs and stacked together to create complex heterostructures. Since the emitters are embedded in a monolayer there is no total internal reflection, enabling very high light extraction efficiencies without the need of any additional processing to allow efficient single photon transfer between the host and the underlying PIC. Arrays of 2D-based SPEs can moreover be fabricated deterministically through STEM patterning or strain engineering. Finally, 2D materials grown with high wafer-scale uniformity are becoming more readily available, such that they can be matched at the wafer level with underlying PICs. Here we report on the integration of a WSe{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} monolayer onto a Silicon Nitride (SiN) chip. We demonstrate the coupling of SPEs with the guided mode of a SiN waveguide and study how the on-chip single photon extraction can be maximized by interfacing the 2D-SPE with an integrated dielectric cavity. Our approach allows the use of optimized PIC platforms without the need for additional processing in the host material. In combination with improved wafer-scale CVD growth of 2D materials, this approach provides a promising route towards scalable quantum photonic chips.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Abstract: The LLE was introduced in order to provide a paradigmatic model for spontaneous spatial pattern formation in the field of nonlinear optics. In the first part of this paper we describe in details its historical evolution. We underline, first of all, that the multimode instability of optical bistability represents an important precursor of the LLE. Next, we illustrate how the original LLE was conceived in order to describe pattern formation in the planes transverse with respect to the longitudinal direction of propagation of light in the nonlinear medium contained in the optical cavity. We emphasize, in particular, the crucial role of the low transmission limit (also called mean field limit or uniform field limit in the literature) in determining the simplicity of the equation. In discussing transverse pattern formation in the LLE, we underline incidentally the presence of very important quantum aspects related to squeezing of quantum fluctuations and to quantum imaging. We consider not only the case of global patterns but also localized structures (cavity solitons and their control). Then we turn to the temporal/longitudinal version of the LLE, formulated by Haelterman etÂ al. [H. Haelterman, S. Trillo, S. Wabnitz, Opt. Commun. 91, 401 (1992)], and to its equivalence with the transverse LLE in 1D, discussing especially the phenomenon of temporal cavity solitons, their experimental observation and their control. Finally for the first part we turn to the very recent topic of broadband frequency combs, observed in a versatile multiwavelength coherent source (driven Kerr microcavity), which is raising a lot of interest and of research activities because of its very favourable physical characteristics, which support quite promising applicative perspectives. Kerr microcavities realize in an ideal manner the basic assumptions of the LLE, and the spontaneous formation of travelling patterns along the microcavity is the crucial mechanism which creates the combs and governs their features. Thus the LLE represents a case of spontaneous pattern formation which is immediately linked to a promising applicative avenue. The second part of the paper is devoted to the detailed derivation from the Maxwell-Bloch equations of the temporal/longitudinal LLE which was proposed by ourselves many years ago without providing a complete derivation. Such an equation is equivalent to the standard temporal/longitudinal version of the LLE in the case of anomalous dispersion. Our derivation elucidates in the best way the connection between the temporal/longitudinal version of the LLE and the multimode instability of optical bistability.

abstract = {The emergence of a special type of fluid-like behavior at large scales in one-dimensional (1d) quantum integrable systems, theoretically predicted in 2016, is established experimentally, by monitoring the time evolution of the in situ density profile of a single 1d cloud of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\{}\backslashrm Rb{\}}{\$} atoms trapped on an atom chip after a quench of the longitudinal trapping potential. The theory can be viewed as a dynamical extension of the thermodynamics of Yang and Yang, and applies to the whole range of repulsion strength and temperature of the gas. The measurements, performed on weakly interacting atomic clouds that lie at the crossover between the quasicondensate and the ideal Bose gas regimes, are in very good agreement with the 2016 theory. This contrasts with the previously existing 'conventional' hydrodynamic approach---that relies on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium---, which is unable to reproduce the experimental data.},

Yet, electrically-driven, photonic chip-based microcombs are inhibited by the required high threshold power and the frequency agility of the laser for soliton initiation. Here we demonstrate an electrically-driven soliton microcomb by coupling a IIIâV-material-based (indium phosphide)Â multiple-longitudinal-mode laser diode chip to a high-Q silicon nitrideÂ microresonator fabricated using theÂ photonic Damascene process. The laser diode is self-injection locked to the microresonator, which is accompanied by the narrowing of the laser linewidth, and the simultaneous formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. By tuning the laser diode current, we observe transitions from modulation instability, breather solitons, to single-soliton states. The system operating at anÂ electronically-detectable sub-100-GHz mode spacing requires less than 1 Watt of electrical power, can fit in a volume of ca. 1 cm 3 ,Â and does not require on-chip filters and heaters, thus simplifying the integrated microcomb.},

Furthermore, it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm, relativistic quantum mechanics, is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein's paradox and Zitterbewegung, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr$\backslash$"odinger. These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles, while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects. Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups, where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes. Here, we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion, which is set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the cross-over from relativistic to nonrelativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

We successfully realized three mutually unbiased bases in a four-dimensional Hilbert space, and achieved low and stable quantum bit error rate well below both coherent attack and individual attack limits. Compared to previous demonstrations, the use of a multicore fiber in our protocol provides a much more efficient way to create high-dimensional quantum states, and enables breaking the information efficiency limit of traditional QKD protocols. In addition, the silicon photonic circuits used in our work integrate variable optical attenuators, highly efficient multicore fiber couplers, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers, enabling manipulating high-dimensional quantum states in a compact and stable means.

The burgeoning field of quantum communication relies on the fundamental laws of physics to offer unconditional information security. Here we introduce the key concepts of quantum superposition and entanglement as well as the no-cloning theorem that form the basis of this field. Then, we review basic quantum communication schemes with single and entangled photons and discuss recent experimental progress in ground and space-based quantum communication. Finally, we discuss the emerging field of high-dimensional quantum communication, which promises increased data rates and higher levels of security than ever before. We discuss recent experiments that use the orbital angular momentum of photons for sharing large amounts of information in a secure fashion.},

Multiple FWM products have been investigated by using conventional fibers and ultra-flattened dispersion photonic crystal fibers. Measured results present bandwidths of 300 nm with up to 118 FWM products. We have also demonstrated a flat bandwidth of 110 nm covering the C and L bands, with a small variation of only 1.2 dB between the powers of FWM products, achieved by using highly nonlinear fibers (HNLFs).

The generation of dissipative Kerr solitons provide a mechanism by which coherent optical combs with bandwidth exceeding one octave can be synthesized and have given rise to a host of phenomena, such as the Stokes soliton, soliton crystals, soliton switching, or dispersive waves. Soliton microcombs are compact, are compatible with wafer-scale processing, operate at low power, can operate with gigahertz to terahertz line spacing, and can enable the implementation of frequency combs in remote and mobile environments outside the laboratory environment, on Earth, airborne, or in outer space.},

abstract = {The quantum internet is predicted to be the next-generation information processing platform, promising secure communication and an exponential speed-up in distributed computation. The distribution of single qubits over large distances via quantum teleportation is a key ingredient for realizing such a global platform. By using quantum teleportation, unknown quantum states can be transferred over arbitrary distances to a party whose location is unknown. Since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of independent external qubits, an internal qubit and squeezed states, researchers have progressively extended the communication distance. Usually this occurs without active feed-forward of the classical Bell-state measurement result, which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication between quantum computers. The benchmark for a global quantum internet is quantum teleportation of independent qubits over a free-space link whose attenuation corresponds to the path between a satellite and a ground station. Here we report such an experiment, using active feed-forward in real time. The experiment uses two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, over 143-kilometres between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, we combine advanced techniques involving a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average teleported state fidelity is well beyond the classical limit of two-thirds. Furthermore, we confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure without feed-forward by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment verifies the maturity and applicability of such technologies in real-world scenarios, in particular for future satellite-based quantum teleportation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The interaction of these trapped photons with Rydberg atoms crossing the cavity illustrates fundamental aspects of measurement theory. The experiments performed with this "photon box" at Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) belong to the domain of quantum optics called "Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics". We have realized the non-destructive counting of photons, the recording of field quantum jumps, the preparation and reconstruction of "Schrodinger cat" states of radiation and the study of their decoherence, which provides a striking illustration of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. These experiments have also led to the demonstration of basic steps in quantum information processing, including the deterministic entanglement of atoms and the realization of quantum gates using atoms and photons as quantum bits. This lecture starts by an introduction stressing the connection between the ENS photon box and the ion trap experiments of David Wineland, whose accompanying lecture recalls his own contribution to the field of single particle control. I give then a personal account of the early days of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics before describing the main experiments performed at ENS during the last twenty years and concluding by a discussion comparing our work to other researches dealing with the control of single quantum particles.},

Using four photons, we can actively delay the choice of measurement - implemented through a high-speed tunable bipartite-state analyser and a quantum random-number generator - on two of the photons into the time-like future of the registration of the other two photons. This effectively projects the two already registered photons onto one of two mutually exclusive quantum states in which the photons are either entangled (quantum correlations) or separable (classical correlations).

abstract = {Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS, ripples) are a universal phenomenon and can be generated on almost any material upon irradiation with linearly polarized radiation. With the availability of ultrashort laser pulses, LIPSS have gained an increasing attraction during the past decade, since these structures can be generated in a simple single-step process, which allows a surface nanostructuring for tailoring optical, mechanical and chemical surface properties. In this article, the current state in the field of LIPSS is reviewed. Their formation mechanisms are analyzed in ultrafast time-resolved scattering, diffraction and polarization constrained double-pulse experiments. These experiments allow to address the question whether the LIPSS are seeded via ultrafast energy deposition mechanisms acting during the absorption of optical radiation or via self-organization after the irradiation process. Relevant control parameters of LIPSS are identified and technological applications featuring surface functionalization in the fields of optics, fluidics, medicine, and tribology are discussed.},

abstract = {Microresonator Kerr frequency combs could provide miniaturised solutions for a wide range of applications. Many of these applications however require further manipulation of the generated frequency comb signal using photonic elements with strong second-order nonlinearity ($\chi$(2)). To date these functionalities have largely been implemented as discrete components due to material limitations, which comes at the expense of extra system complexity and increased optical losses. Here we demonstrate the generation, filtering and electro-optic modulation of a frequency comb on a single monolithic integrated chip, using a nanophotonic lithium-niobate platform that simultaneously possesses large electro-optic ($\chi$(2)) and Kerr ($\chi$(3)) nonlinearities, and low optical losses. We generate broadband Kerr frequency combs using a dispersion-engineered high-Q lithium-niobate microresonator, select a single comb line using an electrically programmable add-drop filter, and modulate the intensity of the selected line. Our results pave the way towards monolithic integrated frequency comb solutions for spectroscopy, data communication, ranging and quantum photonics.},

abstract = {The self-Kerr interaction is an optical nonlinearity that produces a phase shift proportional to the square of the number of photons in the field. At present, many proposals use nonlinearities to generate photon-photon interactions. For propagating fields these interactions result in undesirable features such as spectral correlation between the photons. Here, we engineer a discrete network composed of cross-Kerr interaction regions to simulate a self-Kerr medium. We compute the one- and two-photon S matrices for fields propagating in this medium. From these scattering matrices we show that our proposal leads to a high fidelity photon-photon gate. In the limit where the number of nodes in the network tends to infinity, the medium approximates a perfect self-Kerr interaction in the one- and two-photon regime.},

However, photonic-integrated circuit technology has advanced to high-index-contrast (HIC) waveguides. In this paper, we improve Marcatili's model by adjusting the amplitudes of the components of the electromagnetic fields in his description. We find that Marcatili's eigenvalue equation for the propagation constant is also valid for HIC waveguides. Our improved method shows much better agreement with rigorous numerical simulations, in particular for the case of HIC waveguides. We also derive explicit expressions for the effective group index and the effects of external forces on the propagation constant. Furthermore, with our method, the phenomenon of avoided crossing of modes is observed and studied. {\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Photonic quantum technologies allow quantum phenomena to be exploited in applications such as quantum cryptography, quantum simulation and quantum computation. A key requirement for practical devices is the scalable integration of single-photon sources, detectors and linear optical elements on a common platform. Nanophotonic circuits enable the realization of complex linear optical systems, while non-classical light can be measured with waveguide-integrated detectors. However, reproducible single-photon sources with high brightness and compatibility with photonic devices remain elusive for fully integrated systems. Here, we report the observation of antibunching in the light emitted from an electrically driven carbon nanotube embedded within a photonic quantum circuit. Non-classical light generated on chip is recorded under cryogenic conditions with waveguide-integrated superconducting single-photon detectors, without requiring optical filtering. Because exclusively scalable fabrication and deposition methods are used, our results establish carbon nanotubes as promising nanoscale single-photon emitters for hybrid quantum photonic devices. P hotonic quantum technologies transform classical information processing devices into next-generation systems by exploiting quantum superposition and entanglement. Besides a wealth of applications in quantum cryptography 1 , quantum computation 2,3 and quantum metrology, recent progress in implementing photonic quantum simulators 4â6 holds promise to lead to the first practical applications that are out of reach of classical computation hardware. An exciting example is the highly accurate computation of binding energies for molecular compounds 5,6 for which full configuration interaction simulations can become intractable for classical compu-ters. The introduction of the boson sampling problem to emulate the permanent of transition matrices in photonic quantum simu-lators further provides a promising route to establish quantum com-putational supremacy using optical systems 7 . Scalable processes are needed to co-fabricate linear photonic components, single-photon sources and multiple single-photon detectors 2,8 . Although tremen-dous progress has been made towards the scalable implementation of each individual sub-component by itself, the integration of all three elements on a common chip remains challenging. In particu-lar, the realization of sizable arrays of integrated single-photon sources that interface well with nanophotonic waveguides has proven to be difficult.},

Here we report the reversible transfer of photon-photon entanglement into entanglement between a photon and a collective atomic excitation in a solid-state device. Towards this end, we employ a thulium-doped lithium niobate waveguide in conjunction with a photon-echo quantum memory protocol, and increase the spectral acceptance from the current maximum of 100âmegahertz to 5âgigahertz. We assess the entanglement-preserving nature of our storage device through Bell inequality violations and by comparing the amount of entanglement contained in the detected photon pairs before and after the reversible transfer. These measurements show, within statistical error, a perfect mapping process. Our broadband quantum memory complements the family of robust, integrated lithium niobate devices. It simplifies frequency-matching of light with matter interfaces in advanced applications of quantum communication, bringing fully quantum-enabled networks a step closer.},

In particular, linking cascaded four-wave mixing with direct higher-order nonlinear processes allows us to derive a simple phase matching condition that governs nonlinear symmetry breaking in the presence of higher-order dispersion. We discuss how this mechanism provides a physical interpretation of soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation and associated spectral recoil in terms of phase-matched frequency mixing pumped by bichromatic pump pairs in the soliton spectrum. Theoretical and numerical predictions are confirmed via experiments using both quasicontinuous wave and picosecond pulse excitation.},

The largest reduction in of N-H bond density is shown to respond from SiH 4  flow, indicating that all precursor gases must be optimized for low loss waveguides. A linear correlation of N-H bond density with propagation losses in SiN x  waveguides is observed, allowing for a propagation loss to be estimated by N-H bond density without waveguide fabrication.

However, integrated devices that allow arbitrary transformations of the polarization state are very difficult to produce with conventional lithographic technologies. Here we demonstrate waveguide-based optical waveplates, with arbitrarily rotated birefringence axis, fabricated by femtosecond laser pulses. To validate our approach, we exploit this component to realize a compact device for the quantum state tomography of two polarization-entangled photons.

Since they commonly rely on ferrite materials requiring large magnetic fields that make them bulky and lossy, there has been significant interest in magnetic-field-free on-chip alternatives, such as those recently implemented using the Josephson nonlinearity. Here, we realize reconfigurable nonreciprocal transmission between two microwave modes using purely optomechanical interactions in a superconducting electromechanical circuit. The scheme relies on the interference in two mechanical modes that mediate coupling between the microwave cavities and requires no magnetic field. We analyse the isolation, transmission and the noise properties of this nonreciprocal circuit. Finally, we show how quantum-limited circulators can be realized with the same principle. All-optomechanically mediated nonreciprocity demonstrated here can also be extended to directional amplifiers, and it forms the basis towards realizing topological states of light and sound.},

Here we report the first demonstration of PT-symmetry breaking in optical resonator systems by using two directly coupled on-chip optical whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microtoroid silica resonators. Gain in one of the resonators is provided by optically pumping Erbium (Er3+) ions embedded in the silica matrix; the other resonator exhibits passive loss. The coupling strength between the resonators is adjusted by using nanopositioning stages to tune their distance. We have observed reciprocal behavior of the PT-symmetric system in the linear regime, as well as a transition to nonreciprocity in the PT symmetry-breaking phase transition due to the significant enhancement of nonlinearity in the broken-symmetry phase. Our results represent a significant advance towards a new generation of synthetic optical systems enabling on-chip manipulation and control of light propagation.},

abstract = {Security in quantum cryptography is continuously challenged by inventive attacks targeting the real components of a cryptographic setup, and duly restored by new counter-measures to foil them. Due to their high sensitivity and complex design, detectors are the most frequently attacked components. Recently it was shown that two-photon interference from independent light sources can be exploited to avoid the use of detectors at the two ends of the communication channel. This new form of detection-safe quantum cryptography, called Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MDI-QKD), has been experimentally demonstrated, but with modest delivered key rates. Here we introduce a novel pulsed laser seeding technique to obtain high-visibility interference from gain-switched lasers and thereby perform quantum cryptography without detector vulnerabilities with unprecedented bit rates, in excess of 1 Mb/s. This represents a 2 to 6 orders of magnitude improvement over existing implementations and for the first time promotes the new scheme as a practical resource for quantum secure communications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 Optical Society of America. In this paper, hyper-entanglement on polarization and energy-time is generated based on a silicon micro-ring cavity. The silicon micro-ring cavity is placed in a fiber loop connected by a polarization beam splitter. Photon pairs are generated by the spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in the cavity bi-directionally. The two photon states of photon pairs propagate along the two directions of the fiber loop and are superposed in the polarization beam splitter with orthogonal polarizations, leading to the polarization entanglement generation. On the other hand, the energy-time entanglement is an intrinsic property of photon pairs generated by the SFWM, which maintains in the process of the state superposition. The property of polarization entanglement is demonstrated by the two photon interferences under two non-orthogonal polarization bases. The property of energy-time entanglement is demonstrated by the Franson type interference under two non-orthogonal phase bases. The raw visibilities of all the measured interference fringes are higher than 1/â2, the bench mark for violation of the Bell inequality. It indicates that silicon micro-ring cavity is a promising candidate to realize high performance hyper-entanglement generation.},

This Letter presents both numerical and experimental results of a strip-slot mode converter based on symmetric multimode interference (MMI). Distinct from previous reported converters which gradually convert the mode through sharp tips, the proposed solution makes full use of the symmetry of the two-fold image of MMI, and its field distribution similarity with a slot waveguide to convert the mode. A converter based on this mechanism is able to convert light from a TE-polarized fundamental mode of a strip waveguide to that of a slot waveguide, and vice versa. Strip-slot waveguide coupling though this mode converter has a measured efficiency of 97{\%} (â0.13ââdB), and the dimensions are as small as 1.24Ã6ââ$\mu$m. Further analysis shows that the proposed converter is highly tolerant to fabrication imperfections, and is wavelength-insensitive.},

For the purpose of speeding-up all processes in QKD sequence, we apply a wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technique using the colorless interferometric technique and a key distillation hardware (HW) engine. We establish a novel WDM scheme, sharing interferometers and their temperature regulators over multiple channels, which enables us to increase the number of channels with a small impact on system cost and size. To generate a secure key while satisfying both high speed and high security, we develop a key distillation HW engine which enables us to execute key distillation with 1-Mbit code length in real time. We have experimentally evaluated the performance of the developed system through installed fiber. By operating three wavelength channels, a new, world leading key generation rate of greater than 200 kbps over a 14.5-dB transmission loss has been achieved.},

The resulting high-visibility interference patterns provide an approach to verify frequency-bin entanglement even with slow single-photon detectors; we show interference patterns with visibilities that surpass the classical threshold for qubit and qutrit states. Additionally, we show that with entangled qutrits, two-photon interference occurs even with projections onto different final frequency states.

abstract = {Demonstrating and exploiting the quantum nature of macroscopic mechanical objects would help us to investigate directly the limitations of quantum-based measurements and quantum information protocols, as well as to test long-standing questions about macroscopic quantum coherence. Central to this effort is the necessity of long-lived mechanical states. Previous efforts have witnessed quantum behaviour, but for a low-quality-factor mechanical system. The field of cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, in which a high-quality-factor mechanical oscillator is parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic cavity resonance, provides a practical architecture for cooling, manipulation and detection of motion at the quantum level. One requirement is strong coupling, in which the interaction between the two systems is faster than the dissipation of energy from either system. Here, by incorporating a free-standing, flexible aluminium membrane into a lumped-element superconducting resonant cavity, we have increased the single-photon coupling strength between these two systems by more than two orders of magnitude, compared to previously obtained coupling strengths. A parametric drive tone at the difference frequency between the mechanical oscillator and the cavity resonance dramatically increases the overall coupling strength, allowing us to completely enter the quantum-enabled, strong-coupling regime. This is evidenced by a maximum normal-mode splitting of nearly six bare cavity linewidths. Spectroscopic measurements of these Äâ¬Ì dressed states' are in excellent quantitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The basic circuit architecture presented here provides a feasible path to ground-state cooling and subsequent coherent control and measurement of long-lived quantum states of mechanical motion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators enable the generation of ultrashort pulses and low-noise frequency combs at microwave repetition rates. They have been demonstrated in a growing number of microresonator platforms, enabling chip-scale frequency combs, optical synthesis of low-noise microwaves and multichannel coherent communications. In all these applications, accessing and maintaining a single-soliton state is a key requirement - one that remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we study the dynamics of multiple-soliton states and report the discovery of a simple mechanism that deterministically switches the soliton state by reducing the number of solitons one by one. We demonstrate this control in Si 3 N 4 and MgF 2 resonators and, moreover, we observe a secondary peak to emerge in the response of the system to a pump modulation, an effect uniquely associated with the soliton regime. Exploiting this feature, we map the multi-stability diagram of a microresonator experimentally. Our measurements show the physical mechanism of the soliton switching and provide insight into soliton dynamics in microresonators. The technique provides a method to sequentially reduce, monitor and stabilize an arbitrary state with solitons, in particular allowing for feedback stabilization of single-soliton states, which is necessary for practical applications.},

Sidewall roughness measurements were taken during the fabrication of waveguide devices for various processing conditions. Several fabrication techniques were explored to reduce the sidewall roughness and absorption in the waveguides. Improvements in waveguide quality were established by direct measurement of waveguide propagation loss. The lowest linear waveguide loss measured in these buried channel waveguides was 0.1 dB/cm at a wavelength of 1550 nm. This low propagation loss along with the large refractive index contrast between silicon nitride and silicon dioxide enables high density integration of photonic devices and small PLC's for a variety of applications in photonic sensing and communications.},

To address this challenge, we have developed a novel approach to photonic packaging centered on shifting complexity from chip-level assembly to wafer-level planar fabrication. Self-alignment structures and large-mode converters are integrated on chip to enable photonic packaging in standard, automated, high-throughput microelectronic assembly tools. We demonstrate solutions to interfacing standard optical fibers to chips and to interfacing photonic chips to other photonic chips.

abstract = {High speed optical telecommunication is enabled by wavelength division multiplexing, whereby hundreds of individually stabilized lasers encode the information within a single mode optical fiber. In the seek for larger bandwidth the optical power sent into the fiber is limited by optical non-linearities within the fiber and energy consumption of the light sources starts to become a significant cost factor. Optical frequency combs have been suggested to remedy this problem by generating multiple laser lines within a monolithic device, their current stability and coherence lets them operate only in small parameter ranges. Here we show that a broadband frequency comb realized through the electro-optic effect within a high quality whispering gallery mode resonator can operate at low microwave and optical powers. Contrary to the usual third order Kerr non-linear optical frequency combs we rely on the second order non-linear effect which is much more efficient. Our result uses a fixed microwave signal which is mixed with an optical pump signal to generate a coherent frequency comb with a precisely determined carrier separation. The resonant enhancement enables us to operate with microwave powers three order magnitude smaller than in commercially available devices. We can expect the implementation into the next generation long distance telecommunication which relies on coherent emission and detection schemes to allow for operation with higher optical powers and at reduced cost.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Nonlinear silicon photonic devices have attracted considerable attention thanks to their ability to show large third-order nonlinear effects at moderate power levels allowing for all-optical signal processing functionalities in miniaturized components. Although significant efforts have been made and many nonlinear optical functions have already been demonstrated in this platform, the performance of nonlinear silicon photonic devices remains fundamentally limited at the telecom wavelength region due to the two photon absorption (TPA) and related effects. In this work, we propose an alternative CMOS-compatible platform, based on silicon-rich silicon nitride that can overcome this limitation. By carefully selecting the material deposition parameters, we show that both of the device linear and nonlinear  properties can be tuned in order to exhibit the desired behaviour at the selected wavelength region. A rigorous and systematic fabrication and characterization campaign of different material compositions is presented, enabling us to demonstrate TPA-free CMOS-compatible waveguides with low linear loss (â¼1.5 dB/cm) and enhanced Kerr nonlinear response (Re{\{}$\gamma${\}} = 16 Wm -1 ). Thanks to these properties, our nonlinear waveguides are able to produce a $\pi$ nonlinear phase shift, paving the way for the development of practical devices for future optical communication applications.},

abstract = {This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon need pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully-integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-determistically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states - necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a `ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time-steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such questions.},

abstract = {Weyl points, as a signature of 3D topological states, have been extensively studied in condensed matter systems. Recently, the physics of Weyl points has also been explored in electromagnetic structures such as photonic crystals and metamaterials. These structures typically have complex three-dimensional geometries, which limits the potential for exploring Weyl point physics in on-chip integrated systems. Here we show that Weyl point physics emerges in a system of two-dimensional arrays of resonators undergoing dynamic modulation of refractive index. In addition, the phase of modulation can be controlled to explore Weyl points under different symmetries. Furthermore, unlike static structures, in this system the non-trivial topology of the Weyl point manifests in terms of surface state arcs in the synthetic space that exhibit one-way frequency conversion. Our system therefore provides a versatile platform to explore and exploit Weyl point physics on chip. A Weyl point is a point degeneracy between two bands in a three-dimensional (3D) band structure, with linear dispersion in all three dimensions in its vicinity 1â5 . The simplest Hamiltonian in the wavevector space (k-space) that supports a Weyl point is H Â¼ v x k x s x Ã¾ v y k y s y Ã¾ v z k z s z . As s x,y,z together with the identity matrix form a complete basis for 2 {\^{A}} 2 Hermitian matrices, any perturbation on H that preserves the translational symmetry can be written as a linear superposition of these four matrices. Thus, any small perturbation in k-space can only shift the Weyl point without destroying the degeneracy and opening a gap 5,6 . Weyl points are 3D topological states: they are monopoles of Berry curvature in the wavevector space 7 . Any closed two-dimensional (2D) surface surrounding the Weyl point has a unit Chern number. This implies the existence of topological surface states, in the form of a Fermi arc connecting two Weyl points of opposite charges for a finite system with its bulk described by H 8â10 . A Weyl point is a 3D object. Therefore, previous works on Weyl points in photonics 11â15 , plasmonics 16,17 and acoustics 18,19 have complex 3D geometries, which limits the potential for exploring Weyl point physics in on-chip integrated systems. To explore a Weyl point in a planar 2D geometry, one may use a synthetic dimension 20,21 to simulate the third spatial dimension. The notion of synthetic dimension was previously proposed for superconducting qubits 22 , cold atoms 23 and optics 24 based on the idea of increasing local mode connectivity. One can also form the synthetic dimension using the modes of a ring resonator at different frequencies 25â27 . The size of the synthetic dimension, which corresponds to the number of modes in each individual ring, can be rather large without increasing the system complexity. Here we create a synthetic 3D space by dynamically modulating a 2D array of on-chip ring resonators. Each resonator supports a set of discrete modes equally spaced in resonant frequency. These discrete modes thus form a periodic lattice in the third, synthetic frequency dimension. The two spatial dimensions and one synthetic frequency dimension together form a 3D space. Dynamic modulation of the refractive index leads to effective coupling of modes in the synthetic dimension 25â29 . We show that proper design of the modulation leads to Weyl points in the synthetic space. Our proposed approach is specifically designed for implementation using an existing on-chip integrated photonic platform. Compared with the complex 3D electromagnetic or acoustic structure previously used to demonstrate Weyl point physics 11â19 , our approach provides a far more flexible platform to explore a wide range of phase space. For example, by changing the dynamic modulation phases, the same device can be tuned to exhibit line nodes and Weyl points under inversion or/and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This system also provides a novel manifestation of Weyl point physics in terms of a surface state in the synthetic space that exhibits one-way frequency conversion. More generally, in the context of topological photonics 25â39 , this work points to the significant richness in using dynamic refractive index modulation to achieve novel topological effects. Results Model Hamiltonian system and Weyl points. Our exemplary system consists of a 2D honeycomb array of identical ring resonators as shown in Fig. 1a. In the vicinity of a resonant frequency o 0 , each ring resonator supports a discrete set of resonant modes at frequencies described by [b(o m) {\`{A}} b(o 0)] {\^{A}} L Â¼ 2mp (m Â¼ 0, Â±1, Â±2...), where L is the circumference of the ring and b is the effective wavevector. In the absence of group velocity dispersion, these modes are equally spaced in frequency by the free spectral range O Â¼ 2p},

abstract = {The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). Neutrally charged divacancies in silicon carbide (SiC) are paramagnetic color centers whose long coherence times and near-telecom operating wavelengths make them promising for scalable quantum communication technologies compatible with existing fiber optic networks. However, local strain inhomogeneity can randomly perturb their optical transition frequencies, which degrades the indistinguishability of photons emitted from separate defects and hinders their coupling to optical cavities. Here, we show that electric fields can be used to tune the optical transition frequencies of single neutral divacancy defects in 4H-SiC over a range of several GHz via the DC Stark effect. The same technique can also control the charge state of the defect on microsecond timescales, which we use to stabilize unstable or non-neutral divacancies into their neutral charge state. Using fluorescence-based charge state detection, we show that both 975 nm and 1130 nm excitation can prepare their neutral charge state with near unity efficiency.},

Ultraflat dispersion profiles are achieved for both the fundamental quasi-transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes by utilizing mode transition and anticrossing effects. Dispersion tailoring is carried out for both modes by tuning the structural parameters of the waveguide. There is only a low dispersion of {\textless} Â± 3.8 ps/(nm{\textperiodcentered}km) over a 576-nm and a 817-nm bandwidth for the fundamental quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes, respectively. The reduced dispersion of the modes prevents pulse broadening and intensity reduction in each of the modes. The nonlinear parameters of the modes, the group velocity mismatch, and the characteristic lengths of walk-off and dispersion for both modes are also studied. It is discussed that mode coupling is feasible before the temporal separation of the modes can take place. Therefore, the proposed waveguide can provide highly efficient implementation of photonic applications based on polarization effects.},

Nevertheless, security proofs of traditional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols rely on a crucial assumption, the trustworthiness of the quantum devices used in the protocol. In device-independent QKD, even this last assumption is relaxed: the devices used in the protocol may have been adversarially prepared, and there is no a priori guarantee that they perform according to specification. Proving security in this setting had been a central open problem in quantum cryptography. We give the first device-independent proof of security of a protocol for quantum key distribution that guarantees the extraction of a linear amount of key even when the devices are subject to a constant rate of noise. Our only assumptions are that the laboratories in which each party holds his or her own device are spatially isolated, and that both devices, as well as the eavesdropper, are bound by the laws of quantum mechanics. All previous proofs of security relied either on the use of many independent pairs of devices, or on the absence of noise.},

It is well known that symmetry breaking of the Higgs vacuum field in the early universe possibly induced topological defects in space-time, whose nontrivial effects can provide some clues about the universe's origin. Here, by using an artificial waveguide bounded with rotational metasurface, the nontrivial effects of a topological defect of spacetime are experimentally emulated. The photon deflection in the topological waveguide has a robust definite angle that does not depend on the location and momentum of incident photons. This is remarkably different from the random optical scattering in trivial space. By including material loss such a topological effect can be well understood from the symmetry breaking of photonic modes.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Optical Society of America. Integrated photonics has enabled much progress toward quantum technologies. Many applications, e.g., quantum communication, sensing, and distributed cloud quantum computing, require coherent photonic interconnection between separate on-chip subsystems. Large-scale quantum computing architectures and systems may ultimately require quantum interconnects to enable scaling beyond the limits of a single wafer, and toward multi-chip systems. However, coherently connecting separate chips remains a challenge, due to the fragility of entangled quantum states. The distribution and manipulation of entanglement between multiple integrated devices is one of the strictest requirements of these systems. Here, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first quantum photonic interconnect, demonstrating high-fidelity entanglement distribution and manipulation between two separate photonic chips, implemented using state-of-the-art silicon photonics. Path-entangled states are generated on one chip, and distributed to another chip by interconverting between path and polarization degrees of freedom, via a two-dimensional grating coupler on each chip. This path-to-polarization conversion allows entangled quantum states to be coherently distributed. We use integrated state analyzers to confirm a Bell-type violation of S = 2.638 Â± 0.039 between the two chips. With further improvements in loss, this quantum photonic interconnect will provide new levels of flexibility in quantum systems and architectures.},

The technique bears a resemblance to classical optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, it makes use of a nonclassical entangled twin-photon light source that permits measurements to be made at depths greater than those accessible via OCT, which suffers from the deleterious effects of sample dispersion. Aside from the dispersion cancellation, QOCT offers higher sensitivity than OCT as well as an enhancement of resolution by a factor of two for the same source bandwidth. QOCT and OCT are compared using an idealized sample.},

abstract = {Distributed quantum networks will allow users to perform tasks and to interact in ways which are not possible with present-day technology. Their implementation is a key challenge for quantum science and requires the development of stationary quantum nodes that can send and receive as well as store and process quantum information locally. The nodes are connected by quantum channels for flying information carriers, i.e. photons. These channels serve both to directly exchange quantum information between nodes as well as to distribute entanglement over the whole network. In order to scale such networks to many particles and long distances, an efficient interface between the nodes and the channels is required. This article describes the cavity-based approach to this goal, with an emphasis on experimental systems in which single atoms are trapped in and coupled to optical resonators. Besides being conceptually appealing, this approach is promising for quantum networks on larger scales, as it gives access to long qubit coherence times and high light-matter coupling efficiencies. Thus, it allows one to generate entangled photons on the push of a button, to reversibly map the quantum state of a photon onto an atom, to transfer and teleport quantum states between remote atoms, to entangle distant atoms, to detect optical photons nondestructively, to perform entangling quantum gates between an atom and one or several photons, and even provides a route towards efficient heralded quantum memories for future repeaters. The presented general protocols and the identification of key parameters are applicable to other experimental systems.},

Techniques to control the bandwidth and frequency of the outgoing single photons are of practical importance, allowing direct emission into telecommunications wavelengths and "hybrid" quantum networks incorporating different emitters. Here, we describe an integrated approach involving a quantum emitter coupled to a nonlinear optical resonator, in which the emission wavelength and pulse shape are controlled using the intra-cavity nonlinearity. Our scheme is general in nature, and demonstrates how the photonic environment of a quantum emitter can be tailored to determine the emission properties. As specific examples, we discuss a high Q-factor, TE-TM double-mode photonic crystal cavity design that allows for direct generation of single photons at telecom wavelengths (1425 nm) starting from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot with a 950 nm transition wavelength, and a scheme for direct optical coupling between such a quantum dot and a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center at 637 nm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Optical Society of America.},

However, the characterization of a large array of squeezers that coexist in a single spatial mode is challenging. In this paper we address this problem and propose a straightforward method to determine the number of squeezers and their respective squeezing strengths by using broadband multimode correlation function measurements. These measurements employ the large detection windows of state of the art avalanche photodiodes to simultaneously probe the full Hilbert space of the generated state, which enables us to benchmark the squeezed states. Moreover, due to the structure of correlation functions, our measurements are not affected by losses. This is a significant advantage, since detectors with low efficiencies are sufficient. Our approach is less costly than full state tomography methods relying on multimode homodyne detection which build on much more demanding measurement and analysis tools and appear to be impractical for large Hilbert spaces.},

abstract = {In atomic laser cooling, preparation of the motional quantum ground state has been achieved using resolved-sideband cooling of trapped ions. Here, we report the first demonstration of resolved-sideband cooling of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator, a key step towards ground-state cooling as quantum back-action is sufficiently suppressed in this scheme. A laser drives the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity resonance, the decay rate of which is twenty times smaller than the eigenfrequency of the associated mechanical oscillator. Cooling rates above 1.5MHz are attained, three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic dissipation rate of the mechanical device that is independently monitored at the level. Direct spectroscopy of the motional sidebands of the cooling laser confirms the expected suppression of motional increasing processes during cooling. Moreover, using two-mode pumping, this regime could enable motion measurement beyond the standard quantum limit and the concomitant generation of non-classical states of motion. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional superfluidity and quantum turbulence are directly connected to the microscopic dynamics of quantized vortices. However, surface effects have prevented direct observations of coherent vortex dynamics in strongly-interacting two-dimensional systems. Here, we overcome this challenge by confining a two-dimensional droplet of superfluid helium at microscale on the atomically-smooth surface of a silicon chip. An on-chip optical microcavity allows laser-initiation of vortex clusters and nondestructive observation of their decay in a single shot. Coherent dynamics dominate, with thermal vortex diffusion suppressed by six orders-of-magnitude. This establishes a new on-chip platform to study emergent phenomena in strongly-interacting superfluids, test astrophysical dynamics such as those in the superfluid core of neutron stars in the laboratory, and construct quantum technologies such as precision inertial sensors.},

A correlation between the N-H concentration and absorption loss was verified for silicon oxynitride slab waveguides.

One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

The robustness of our fibre-based implementation, together with the enhanced level of security offered by the protocol, confirms QKD as a realistic technology for safeguarding secrets in transmission.

@article{Reimer2019,
abstract = {Taking advantage of quantum mechanics for executing computational tasks faster than classical computers 1 or performing measurements with precision exceeding the classical limit 2,3 requires the generation of specific large and complex quantum states. In this context, cluster states 4 are particularly interesting because they can enable the realization of universal quantum computers by means of a 'one-way' scheme 5 , where processing is performed through measurements 6. The generation of cluster states based on subsystems that have more than two dimensions, d-level cluster states, provides increased quantum resources while keeping the number of parties constant 7 , and also enables novel algorithms 8. Here, we experimentally realize, characterize and test the noise sensitivity of three-level, four-partite cluster states formed by two photons in the time 9 and frequency 10 domain, confirming genuine multi-partite entanglement with higher noise robustness compared to conventional two-level cluster states 6,11-13. We perform proof-of-concept high-dimensional one-way quantum operations, where the cluster states are transformed into orthogonal, maximally entangled d-level two-partite states by means of projection measurements. Our scalable approach is based on integrated photonic chips 9,10 and optical fibre communication components, thus achieving new and determinis-tic functionalities. Cluster states are a particularly important class of multi-par-tite states (that is, those formed by more than two parties, such as multiple atoms, photons and so on) characterized by two unique properties: maximal connectedness 4 (that is, any two parties of the state can be projected into a maximally entangled state through measurements on the remaining parties), as well as by the highest persistency of entanglement 4 (that is, cluster states require a maximal number of projection measurements to fully destroy entangle-ment in the system). These properties make cluster states equivalent to universal one-way (also called measurement-based) quantum computers 5 , where different algorithms can be implemented by performing measurements on the individual parties of the cluster states 5,6. This approach greatly simplifies quantum processing, since measurement settings can be usually implemented more easily than the gate operations required in other approaches 1,14. Furthermore, cluster states have structural properties that protect the quantum information; that is, they enable topological quantum error correction 11 for minimizing computation errors. Due to the significant importance of cluster states, they have been studied in many different platforms. In particular, experimental realizations can be separated into two classes: discrete two-level 6,11-13 (that is, qubit) and continuous-variable 15,16 cluster states. Continuous-variable systems are intrinsically high-dimensional, and they can be achieved using squeezed states 15,16. However, the quantum resource of these states relies on the level of squeezing, which is very sensitive to noise 17. In contrast, discrete quantum states are less sensitive to noise than squeezed states 17 , and even more importantly, their individual modes can be fully accessed and individually manipulated, making their use especially appealing. Nevertheless, increasing the number of particles to boost the computational resource comes at the price of significantly reduced coherence time and detection rates, and increased sensitivity to noise, restricting the realization of discrete cluster states to a record of eight qubits 11. In a novel approach, the use of discrete yet d-level (that is, qudit) entangled states has the potential to address several limitations of qubit cluster states. First, the quantum resource can be increased without changing the number of particles 7 ; second, d-level quantum states enable the implementation of highly efficient computation protocols 8 ; and third, higher dimensions reduce the noise sensitivity of cluster states. The experimental realization of d-level multi-partite cluster states is the key missing piece required to exploit these important benefits for high-dimensional quantum computation 7. Unfortunately, today's established quantum systems are ill-suited for increasing the dimensionality of discrete multi-partite entangled states. For example, atomic 18 and superconduct-ing 19 systems are mainly based on qubit schemes, and demonstrated high-dimensional photonic systems 20,21 become experimentally complex and inefficient and typically suffer from degraded state},

abstract = {Chipscale microresonators with integrated planar optical waveguides are useful building blocks for linear, nonlinear and quantum optical devices. Loss reduction through improving fabrication processes has resulted in several integrated micro resonator platforms attaining quality (Q) factors of several millions. However only few studies have investigated design-dependent losses, especially with regard to the resonator coupling section. Here we investigate design-dependent parasitic losses, described by the coupling ideality, of the commonly employed microresonator design consisting of a microring resonator waveguide side-coupled to a straight bus waveguide. By systematic characterization of multi-mode high-Q silicon nitride microresonator devices, we show that this design can suffer from low coupling ideality. By performing full 3D simulations to numerically investigate the resonator to bus waveguide coupling, we identify the coupling to higher-order bus waveguide modes as the dominant origin of parasitic losses which lead to the low coupling ideality. Using suitably designed bus waveguides, parasitic losses are mitigated, and a nearly unity ideality and strong overcoupling (i.e. a ratio of external coupling to internal resonator loss rate {\textgreater} 9) are demonstrated. Moreover we find that different resonator modes can exchange power through the coupler, which therefore constitutes a mechanism that induces modal coupling, a phenomenon known to distort resonator dispersion properties. Our results demonstrate the potential for significant performance improvements of integrated planar microresonators, achievable by optimized coupler designs.},

Based on this correspondence, we introduce a Kohn-Sham construction which provides a computationally feasible approach for ab-initio light-matter interactions. In the mean-field limit for the effective nuclei the formalism reduces to coupled Ehrenfest-Maxwell-Pauli-Kohn-Sham equations. We present an implementation of the approach in the real-space real-time code Octopus. For the implementation we use the Riemann-Silberstein formulation of classical electrodynamics and rewrite Maxwell's equations in Schr$\backslash$"odinger form. This allows us to use existing time-evolution algorithms developed for quantum-mechanical systems also for Maxwell's equations. Overall, our approach is ideally suited for applications in nano-optics, nano-plasmonics, (photo) electrocatalysis, light-matter coupling in 2D materials, cases where laser pulses carry orbital angular momentum, or light-tailored chemical reactions in optical cavities to name but a few.},

abstract = {Multi-photon interference reveals strictly non-classical phenomena. Its applications range from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to photonic quantum information processing, where a significant fraction of key experiments achieved so far comes from multi-photon state manipulation. We review the progress, both theoretical and experimental, of this rapidly advancing research. The emphasis is given to the creation of photonic entanglement of various forms, tests of the completeness of quantum mechanics (in particular, violations of local realism), quantum information protocols for quantum communication (e.g., quantum teleportation, entanglement purification and quantum repeater), and quantum computation with linear optics. We shall limit the scope of our review to "few photon" phenomena involving measurements of discrete observables.},

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks are computational network models inspired by signal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved the performance of many learning tasks, including speech and object recognition. However, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann computing schemes. Significant effort has been made to develop electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that improve upon both computational speed and energy efficiency. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully-optical neural network that, using unique advantages of optics, promises a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art and three orders of magnitude in power efficiency for conventional learning tasks. We experimentally demonstrate essential parts of our architecture using a programmable nanophotonic processor.},

The resulting 2-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the thermorefractive coefficient relative to room temperature enables direct access to single bright Kerr soliton states through adiabatic frequency tuning of the pump laser while remaining in thermal equilibrium. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling, show that single solitons are easily accessible at temperatures below 60 K for the microresonator device under study. We further demonstrate that the cryogenic temperature primarily impacts the thermorefractive coefficient. Other parameters critical to the generation of solitons, such as quality factor, dispersion, and effective nonlinearity, are unaltered. Finally, we discuss the potential improvement in thermorefractive noise resulting from cryogenic operation. The results of this study open up new directions in advancing chip-scale frequency-comb optical clocks and metrology at cryogenic temperatures.},

We demonstrate a prototype device which produces strings of a few hundred photons in which the entanglement persists over 5 sequential photons. The implementation follows a proposal by Lindner and Rudolph (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2009) which suggested periodic timed excitation of a precessing electron spin as a mechanism for entangling the electron spin with the polarization of the sequentially emitted photons. In our realization, the entangling qubit is a quantum dot confined dark exciton. By performing full quantum process tomography, we obtain the process map which fully characterizes the evolution of the system, containing the dark exciton and n photons after n applications of the periodic excitations. Our implementation may greatly reduce the resources needed for quantum information processing.},

Quantum cryptography holds the promise to end this battle by offering unconditional security when ideal single-photon sources and detectors are employed. Unfortunately, ideal devices never exist in practice and device imperfections have become the targets of various attacks. By developing up-conversion single-photon detectors with high efficiency and low noise, we build up a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) system, which is immune to all hacking strategies on detection. Meanwhile, we employ the decoy-state method to defeat attacks on non-ideal source. By closing the loopholes in both source and detection, our practical system, which generates more than 25 kbit secure key over a 50-km fiber link, provides an ultimate solution for communication security.},

Ideally, they should feature low insertion loss, low drive voltage, large modulation bandwidth, high linearity, compact footprint and low manufacturing cost. Unfortunately, these criteria have only been achieved on separate occasions.Based on a Silicon and Lithium Niobate hybrid integration platform, we demonstrate Mach-Zehnder modulators that simultaneously fulfill these criteria. The presented device exhibits an insertion loss of 2.5 dB, voltage-length product of 2.2 Vcm, high linearity, electro-optic bandwidth of at least 70 GHz and modulation rates up to 112 Gbit/s. The high-performance modulator is realized by seamless integration of high-contrast waveguide based on Lithium Niobate - the most mature modulator material - with compact, low-loss silicon circuits. The hybrid platform demonstrated here allows for the combination of 'best-in-breed' active and passive components, opening up new avenues for enabling future high-speed, energy efficient and cost-effective optical communication networks.},

abstract = {Integrated quantum optics has drastically reduced the size of table-top optical experiments to the chip-scale, allowing for demonstrations of large-scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation. However, despite these advances, practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits remain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide interferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale. Increasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees of freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution, polarization, time, and frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by simplifying quantum computational architectures, increasing security and noise tolerance in quantum communication channels, and simulating richer quantum phenomena. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum information processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on the transverse spatial mode degree of freedom: mode multiplexers and mode beamsplitters. A multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of spatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the waveguide. We design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes (per polarization) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum interference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes. We also cascade these structures and demonstrate NOON state interferometry within a multimode waveguide. These devices have potential to perform transformations on more modes and be integrated with existing architectures, providing a scalable path to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement.},

Switching between different optical pumping regimes, we implement the Scattershot, Gaussian and standard boson sampling protocols in the same silicon chip, which integrates linear and nonlinear photonic circuitry.

Here we describe the physics that underpins the formation of such clustered comb states. In particular, we show that the phase-matching required for the initial sideband generation is such that (at least) one of the sidebands experiences anomalous dispersion, enabling that sideband to drive frequency comb formation via degenerate and non-degenerate four-wave mixing. We validate our proposal through a combination of experimental observations made in a magnesium-fluoride microresonator and corresponding numerical simulations. We also investigate the coherence properties of the resulting clustered frequency combs. Our findings provide valuable insights on the generation and dynamics of widely-spaced parametric sidebands and clustered frequency combs in Kerr microresonators.},

abstract = {Microresonator frequency combs (microcombs) are enabling new applications in frequency synthesis and metrology from high-speed laser ranging to coherent optical communications. One critical parameter that dictates the performance of the microcomb is the optical quality factor (Q) of the microresonator. Microresonators fabricated in planar structures such as silicon nitride (Si3N4) allow for dispersion engineering and the possibility to monolithically integrate the microcomb with other photonic devices. However, the relatively large refractive index contrast and the tight optical confinement required for dispersion engineering make it challenging to attain Si3N4 microresonators with Qs {\textgreater} 10 000 000 using standard subtractive processing methods. In this work, we achieve ultra-smooth Si3N4 microresonators featuring mean intrinsic Qs around 11 million. The cross-section geometry can be precisely engineered in the telecommunications band to achieve either normal or anomalous dispersion, and we demonstrate the generation of mode-locked dark-pulse Kerr combs as well as soliton microcombs. Such high-Qs allow us to generate soliton microcombs with photodetectable repetition rates, demonstrated here for the first time in Si3N4 microresonators fabricated using a subtractive processing method. These results enhance the possibilities for co-integration of microcombs with high-performance photonic devices, such as narrow-linewidth external-cavity diode lasers, ultra-narrow filters and demultiplexers.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, remarkable advances have been realized in chip-based nonlinear photonic devices for classical and quantum applications in the near- and mid-infrared regimes. However, few demonstrations have been realized in the visible and near-visible regimes, primarily due to the large normal material group-velocity dispersion (GVD) that makes it challenging to phase match third-order parametric processes. In this paper, we show that exploiting dispersion engineering of higher-order waveguide modes provides waveguide dispersion that allows for small or anomalous GVD in the visible and near-visible regimes and phase matching of four-wave mixing processes. We illustrate the power of this concept by demonstrating in silicon nitride microresonators a near-visible modelocked Kerr frequency comb and a narrow-band photon-pair source compatible with Rb transitions. These realizations extend applications of nonlinear photonics towards the visible and near-visible regimes for applications in time and frequency metrology, spectral calibration, quantum information, and biomedical applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. We propose a Bell-measurement scheme by employing a logical qubit in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement with an arbitrary number of photons. Remarkably, the success probability of the Bell measurement as well as teleportation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement can be made arbitrarily high using only linear optics elements and photon on-off measurements as the number of photons increases. Our scheme outperforms previous proposals using single-photon qubits when comparing the success probabilities in terms of the average photon usages. It has another important advantage for experimental feasibility in that it does not require photon-number-resolving measurements. Our proposal provides an alternative candidate for all-optical quantum information processing.},

This coupling can strongly modify the resonator local effective dispersion by creating two branches that have dispersions of opposite sign in spectral regions that would otherwise be characterized by either positive (normal) or negative (anomalous) dispersion. In this paper, we study, both analytically and computationally, the general properties of nonlinear frequency comb generation at an avoided crossing using the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equation. In particular, we find that bright solitons and broadband frequency combs can be excited when both branches are pumped for a suitable choice of the pump powers and the detuning parameters.

abstract = {The strong-coupling regime of cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (cQED) represents light-matter interaction at the fully quantum level. Adding a single photon shifts the resonance frequencies, a profound nonlinearity. cQED is a test-bed of quantum optics and the basis of photon-photon and atom-atom entangling gates. At microwave frequencies, success in cQED has had a transformative effect. At optical frequencies, the gates are potentially much faster and the photons can propagate over long distances and be easily detected, ideal features for quantum networks. Following pioneering work on single atoms, solid-state implementations are important for developing practicable quantum technology. Here, we embed a semiconductor quantum dot in a microcavity. The microcavity has a {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}Q{\}}{\$}-factor close to {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}6{\}}{\$} and contains a charge-tunable quantum dot with close-to-transform-limited optical linewidth. The exciton-photon coupling rate {\$}g{\$} exceeds both the photon decay rate {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} and exciton decay rate {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} by a large margin ({\$}g/\backslashgamma=14{\$}, {\$}g/\backslashkappa=5.3{\$}); the cooperativity is {\$}C=2g{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}/(\backslashgamma \backslashkappa)=150{\$}, the {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-factor 99.7{\%}. We observe pronounced vacuum Rabi oscillations in the time-domain, photon blockade at a one-photon resonance, and highly bunched photon statistics at a two-photon resonance. We use the change in photon statistics as a sensitive spectral probe of transitions between the first and second rungs of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder. All experiments can be described quantitatively with the Jaynes-Cummings model despite the complexity of the solid-state environment. We propose this system as a platform to develop optical-cQED for quantum technology, for instance a photon-photon entangling gate.},

In the optical regime, silicon photonics empowered by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology provides optical components useful for realizing large-scale QPICs. Optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level is required for QPIC to facilitate photon-photon interaction. However, to date, realization of optical elements with deterministic( i.e., not probabilistic) single-photon nonlinearity by using silicon-based components is challenging, despite the enhancement of the functionality of QPICs based on silicon photonics. In this study, we realize for the first time a strongly coupled InAs/GaAs quantum dot-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system on a CMOS-processed silicon photonic chip. The heterogeneous integration of the GaAs cavity on the silicon chip is performed by transfer printing. The cavity QED system on the CMOS photonic chip realized in this work is a promising candidate for on-chip single-photon nonlinear element, which constitutes the fundamental component for future applications based on QPIC, such as, coherent manipulation and nondestructive measurement of qubit states via a cavity, and efficient single-photon filter and router.},

By patterning the waveguide structures firstly and then carrying out a high-temperature annealing process, not only sufficient waveguide thickness can be achieved, which gives more freedom to waveguide dispersion control, but also the material absorption loss in the waveguides be greatly reduced. The linear optical loss of the fabricated waveguide with a cross-section of 2.0 Ã 0.58 Âµm 2 was measured to be as low as 0.58 dB/cm. The same loss level is demonstrated over a broad wavelength range from 1500 nm to 1630 nm.

The impact of the classical channels to the quantum channel has been investigated for both QKD based on single photon detection and QKD based on homodyne detection. Our studies show that the latter can tolerate a much higher level of contamination from the classical channels than the former. This is because the local oscillator used in the homodyne detector acts as a "mode selector" which can suppress noise photons effectively. We have performed simulations based on both the decoy BB84 QKD protocol and the Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) QKD protocol. While the former cannot tolerate even one classical channel (with a power of 0dBm), the latter can be multiplexed with 38 classical channels (0dBm power each channel) and still has a secure distance around 10km.

abstract = {Bell's theorem states that some predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by a local-realist theory. That conflict is expressed by Bell's inequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no statistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and anything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous experiments, this "freedom of choice" was addressed by ensuring that selection of measurement settings via conventional "quantum random number generators" was space-like separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left open the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices and measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each experimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell's inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as "cosmic setting generators." In our tests with polarization-entangled photons, measurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way stars while simultaneously ensuring locality. Assuming fair sampling for all detected photons, and that each stellar photon's color was set at emission, we observe statistically significant {\$}\backslashgtrsim 7.31 \backslashsigma{\$} and {\$}\backslashgtrsim 11.93 \backslashsigma{\$} violations of Bell's inequality with estimated {\$}p{\$}-values of {\$} \backslashlesssim 1.8 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-13{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashlesssim 4.0 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-33{\}}{\$}, respectively, thereby pushing back by {\$}\backslashsim{\$}600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist influences could have engineered the observed Bell violation.},

These devices offer high efficiency, low dark counts and excellent timing resolution. In this review, we consider the basic SNSPD operating principle and models of device behaviour. We give an overview of the evolution of SNSPD device design and the improvements in performance which have been achieved. We also evaluate device limitations and noise mechanisms. We survey practical refrigeration technologies and optical coupling schemes for SNSPDs. Finally we summarize promising application areas, ranging from quantum cryptography to remote sensing.

In contrast to conventional ring cavity lasers with multiple competing modes, our parity-time microring laser exhibits intrinsic single-mode lasing regardless of the gain spectral bandwidth. Thresholdless parity-time symmetry breaking due to the rotationally symmetric structure leads to stable single-mode operation with the selective whispering-gallery mode order.

Now results that take their cue from theoretical ideas of parity-time symmetry and implement them into the design of coupled laser components show that loss and gain can actually work together. Feng et al. and Hodaei et al. designed laser systems based on microring cavities to carefully control the amount of loss and gain within each component. The interplay between the loss and gain resulted in enhanced and cleaner emission from their lasers.$\backslash$nScience, this issue p. 972, p. 975},

Here, we exploit a recent connection between quantum experiments and graph theory and answer this question for a plethora of classes of entangled states. We find experimental setups for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, W states, general Dicke states, and asymmetrically high-dimensional multipartite entangled states.

abstract = {Temporal dissipative solitons in a continuous-wave laser-driven nonlinear optical microresonator were observed. The solitons were generated spontaneously when the laser frequency was tuned through the effective zero detuning point of a high-Q resonance, which led to an effective red-detuned pumping. Transition to soliton states were characterized by discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. The solitons were stable in the long term and their number could be controlled via pump-laser detuning. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations and soliton theory. Operating in the single-soliton regime allows the continuous output coupling of a femtosecond pulse train directly from the microresonator. This approach enables ultrashort pulse syntheses in spectral regimes in which broadband laser-gain media and saturable absorbers are not available. In the frequency domain the single-soliton states correspond to low-noise optical frequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes, critical to applications in broadband spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy and low noise microwave generation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Air mode is utilized to confine the optical field into photonic crystal (PhC) air holes, which is confirmed by the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulation. PhCRR structure is employed to enhance the light-matter interaction through combining the whispering-gallery mode resonance of ring resonator with the slow-light effect in PhC waveguide. In the simulated and measured transmission spectra of air-mode PhCRR, nonuniform free spectral ranges are observed near the Brillouin zone edge of PhC, indicating the presence of the slow-light effect. A maximum group index of 27.3 and a highest quality factor of 14600 are experimentally obtained near the band edge. Benefiting from the strong optical confinement in the PhC holes and enhanced light-matter interaction in the resonator, the demonstrated air-mode PhCRR is expected to have potential applications in refractive index sensing, on-chip light emitting and nonlinear optics by integration with functional materials.},

To date, the most widely-used entangled photon pairs are generated from spontaneous parametric downconversion, a process that is intrinsically probabilistic and thus relegated to a regime of low pair-generation rates. In contrast, semiconductor quantum dots can generate triggered entangled photon pairs via a cascaded radiative decay process, and do not suffer from any fundamental trade-off between source brightness and multi-pair generation. However, a source featuring simultaneously high photon-extraction efficiency, high-degree of entanglement fidelity and photon indistinguishability has not yet been reported. Here, we present an entangled photon pair source with high brightness and indistinguishability by deterministically embedding GaAs quantum dots in broadband photonic nanostructures that enable Purcell-enhanced emission. Our source produces entangled photon pairs with a record pair collection probability of up to 0.65(4) (single-photon extraction efficiency of 0.85(3)), entanglement fidelity of 0.88(2), and indistinguishabilities of 0.901(3) and 0.903(3), which immediately creates opportunities for advancing quantum photonic technologies.},

These effects, which include a significant degradation of the heralding efficiency, depend strongly on the relative strengths of the coupling of the ring modes to loss modes and channel modes. We show that the common choice of critical coupling does not optimize the rate of successfully heralded photons, and derive the coupling condition needed to do so, as well as the condition needed to maximize the rate of coincidence counts.

We show that the proposed platform is compatible with standard commercial spectral domain (SD) OCT systems and enable imaging of human tissue with an image quality comparable to the one achieved with tabletop commercial sources. This platform provides a path towards fully integrated OCT systems. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that provides depth-resolved, high-resolution images of tissue microstructures in real-time. OCT has been widely demonstrated in medical fields such as ophthalmology and cardiology 1. Recently, great efforts have been spent on the development of on-chip OCT components in order to enable OCT systems with small footprint and cost 2-6. These efforts have leveraged recent advances in photonic integration on-chip including the beam splitter, reference arm, sampling arm and spectrometer 2-6. However, the degree of miniaturization of the OCT system based on the miniaturization of these components is limited, since these systems still rely on an external, tabletop light source such as a superluminescent diode (SLD) or swept source laser that cannot be easily integrated with current photonics on a silicon platform. Here we introduce a platform for a miniaturized OCT source based on chip-scale lithographically-defined microresonators.

Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.},

abstract = {Quantum cascade laser (QCL) frequency combs are a promising candidate for chemical sensing and biomedical diagnostics, requiring only milliseconds of acquisition time to record absorption spectra without any moving parts. They are electrically pumped and have a small footprint, making them an ideal platform for on-chip integration. Until now, optical feedback is fatal for frequency comb generation in QCLs and destroys intermodal coherence. This property imposes strict limits on the possible degree of integration. Here, we demonstrate coherent injection locking of the repetition frequency to a stabilized RF oscillator. For the first time, we prove that the spectrum of the injection locked QCL can be phase-locked, resulting in the generation of a frequency comb. We show that injection locking is not only a versatile tool for all-electrical frequency stabilization, but also mitigates the fatal effect of optical feedback on the frequency comb. A prototype self-detected dual-comb setup consisting only of an injection locked dual-comb chip, a lens and a mirror demonstrates the enormous potential for on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy. These results pave the way to miniaturized and all-solid-state mid-infrared spectrometers.},

CMOS platforms operating at the telecommunications wavelength either reside within the highly dissipative two-photon regime in silicon-based optical devices, or possess small nonlinearities. Bandgap engineering of non-stoichiometric silicon nitride using state-of-the-art fabrication techniques has led to our development of USRN (ultra-silicon-rich nitride) in the form of Si 7 N 3 , that possesses a high Kerr nonlinearity (2.8 Ã 10- 13 cm 2 W - 1 ), an order of magnitude larger than that in stoichiometric silicon nitride. Here we experimentally demonstrate high-gain optical parametric amplification using USRN, which is compositionally tailored such that the 1,550 nm wavelength resides above the two-photon absorption edge, while still possessing large nonlinearities. Optical parametric gain of 42.5 dB, as well as cascaded four-wave mixing with gain down to the third idler is observed and attributed to the high photon efficiency achieved through operating above the two-photon absorption edge, representing one of the largest optical parametric gains to date on a CMOS platform.},

A major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments. We investigate this question by using the projective simulation model, a physics-oriented approach to artificial intelligence. In our approach, the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments. The artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states and improves the efficiency of their realization. In the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experimentsâa trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning. Such features highlight the possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in future research.},

abstract = {Canonical quantum mechanics postulates Hermitian Hamiltonians to ensure real eigenvalues. Counterintuitively, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, satisfying combined parity-time (PT) symmetry, could display entirely real spectra above some phase-transition threshold. Such a counterintuitive discovery has aroused extensive theoretical interest in extending canonical quantum theory by including non-Hermitian but PT-symmetric operators in the last two decades. Despite much fundamental theoretical success in the development of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, an experimental observation of pseudo-Hermiticity remains elusive as these systems with a complex potential seem absent in Nature. But nevertheless, the notion of PT symmetry has highly survived in many other branches of physics including optics, photonics, AMO physics, acoustics, electronic circuits, material science over the past ten years, and others, where a judicious balance of gain and loss constitutes a PT-symmetric system. Here, although we concentrate upon reviewing recent progress on PT symmetry in optical microcavity systems, we also wish to present some new results that may help to accelerate the research in the area. Such compound photonic structures with gain and loss provide a powerful platform for testing various theoretical proposals on PT symmetry, and initiate new possibilities for shaping optical beams and pulses beyond conservative structures. Throughout this article there is an effort to clearly present the physical aspects of PT-symmetry in optical microcavity systems, but mathematical formulations are reduced to the indispensable ones. Readers who prefer strict mathematical treatments should resort to the extensive list of references. Despite the rapid progress on the subject, new ideas and applications of PT symmetry using optical microcavities are still expected in the future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Optical Society of America.On-chip optical resonators have the promise of revolutionizing numerous fields, including metrology and sensing; however, their optical losses have always lagged behind those of their larger discrete resonator counterparts based on crystalline materials and silica microtoroids. Silicon nitride (Si3N4) ring resonators open up capabilities for frequency comb generation, optical clocks, and high-precision sensing on an integrated platform. However, simultaneously achieving a high quality factor (Q) and high confinement in Si3N4 (critical for nonlinear processes, for example) remains a challenge. Here we show that addressing surface roughness enables overcoming the loss limitations and achieving high-confinement on-chip ring resonators with Q of 37 million for a ring of 2.5 $\mu$m width and 67 million for a ring of 10 $\mu$m width. We show a clear systematic path for achieving these high Qs, and these techniques can also be used to reduce losses in other material platforms independent of geometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate optical parametric oscillation using the 2.5 $\mu$m wide ring with sub-milliwatt pump powers and extract the loss limited by the material absorption in our films to be 0.13 Â± 0.05 dB/m, which corresponds to an absorption-limited Q of at least 170 million by comparing two resonators with different degrees of confinement. Our work provides a chip-scale platform for applications such as ultralow-power frequency comb generation, laser stabilization, and sidebandresolved optomechanics.},

In our theoretical analysis we show how this reduces the high-dimensional photon state to an effective two-dimensional state. This is of interest for applications such as quantum cryptography or low-dimensional tests of quantum nonlocality. We then report an experimental realization of this proposal.

Here we demonstrate a novel approach to create mid-infrared optical frequency combs via four-wave mixing in a continuous-wave pumped ultra-high Q crystalline microresonator made of magnesium fluoride. Careful choice of the resonator material and design made it possible to generate a broadband, low-phase noise Kerr comb at $\lambda$=2.5 $\mu$m spanning 200 nm (â10 THz) with a line spacing of 100 GHz.

abstract = {Quantum information processing holds great promise for communicating and computing data efficiently. However, scaling current photonic implementation approaches to larger system size remains an outstanding challenge for realizing disruptive quantum technology. Two main ingredients of quantum information processors are quantum interference and single-photon detectors. Here we develop a hybrid superconducting-photonic circuit system to show how these elements can be combined in a scalable fashion on a silicon chip. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach for integrated quantum optics by interfering and detecting photon pairs directly on the chip with waveguide-coupled single-photon detectors. Using a directional coupler implemented with silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides, we observe 97{\%} interference visibility when measuring photon statistics with two monolithically integrated superconducting single-photon detectors. The photonic circuit and detector fabrication processes are compatible with standard semiconductor thin-film technology, making it possible to implement more complex and larger scale quantum photonic circuits on silicon chips.},

abstract = {Transformations on quantum states form a basic building block of every quantum information system. From photonic polarization to two-level atoms, complete sets of quantum gates for a variety of qubit systems are well known. For multi-level quantum systems beyond qubits, the situation is more challenging. The orbital angular momentum modes of photons comprise one such high-dimensional system for which generation and measurement techniques are well-studied. However, arbitrary transformations for such quantum states are not known. Here we experimentally demonstrate a four-dimensional generalization of the Pauli X-gate and all of its integer powers on single photons carrying orbital angular momentum. Together with the well-known Z-gate, this forms the first complete set of high-dimensional quantum gates implemented experimentally. The concept of the X-gate is based on independent access to quantum states with different parities and can thus be easily generalized to other photonic degrees-of-freedom, as well as to other quantum systems such as ions and superconducting circuits.},

So far, the most flexible phase-matching technique, i.e. quasi phase matching, has not been applied in this configuration. The reason is the lack of suitable thin films with alternating crystal structure on a low-refractive-index substrate. Here, we demonstrate an innovative method of realizing thin film substrates suitable for quasi phase matching by field-assisted domain engineering of lithium niobate, and subsequent direct bonding and polishing. We are able to fabricate high-Q on-chip WGRs with these substrates by using standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques. The Q-factors of the resonators are up to one million, which allows us to demonstrate quasi-phase-matched second-harmonic generation in on-chip WGRs for the first time. The normalized conversion efficiency is {\$}9\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}\backslash,\backslashtextrm{\{}mW{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}.

To this end, genuine multipartite entanglement have been reported up to 14 trapped ions, 10 photons, and 10 superconducting qubits. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an 18-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement by simultaneous exploiting three different DoFs of six photons, including their paths, polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM). We develop high-stability interferometers for reversible quantum logic operations between the photon's different DoFs with precision and efficiencies close to unity, enabling simultaneous readout of 262,144 outcome combinations of the 18-qubit state.

abstract = {Conversion between signals in the microwave and optical domains is of great interest both for classical telecommunication, as well as for connecting future superconducting quantum computers into a global quantum network. For quantum applications, the conversion has to be both efficient, as well as operate in a regime of minimal added classical noise. While efficient conversion has been demonstrated with several approaches using mechanical transducers, they have so far all operated with a substantial thermal noise background. Here, we overcome this limitation and demonstrate coherent conversion between GHz microwave signals and the optical telecom band with a thermal background of less than one phonon. We use an electro-opto-mechanical device, that couples surface acoustic waves driven by a resonant microwave signal to an optomechanical crystal featuring a 2.7 GHz mechanical mode. By operating at Millikelvin temperatures, we can initialize the mechanical mode in its quantum groundstate, which allows us to perform the transduction process with less than one quantum of added thermal noise. We further verify the preservation of the coherence of the microwave signal throughout the transduction process.},

abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) schemes that use multi-qubit large block codes can potentially reduce the resource overhead to a great extent. A major obstacle is the requirement of a large number of clean ancilla states of different types without correlated errors inside each block. These ancilla states are usually logical stabilizer states of the data code blocks, which are generally difficult to prepare if the code size is large. Previously we have proposed an ancilla distillation protocol for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes by classical error-correcting codes. It was assumed that the quantum gates in the distillation circuit were perfect; however, in reality, noisy quantum gates may introduce correlated errors that are not treatable by the protocol. In this paper, we show that additional postselection by another classical error-detecting code can be applied to remove almost all correlated errors. Consequently, the revised protocol is fully fault-tolerant and capable of preparing a large set of stabilizer states sufficient for FTQC using large block codes. At the same time, the yield rate can be high for general CSS codes of arbitrary size. Ancilla preparation for the [[23,1,7]] quantum Golay code is numerically studied in detail through Monte Carlo simulation. The results support the validity of the protocol when the gate failure rate is reasonably low. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to prepare general large block stabilizer states free of correlated errors for FTQC in a fault-tolerant and efficient manner.},

Although the generation rates of the noise photons are one order of magnitude higher than that of the photon-pairs under CW pumping, the impact of noise photons can be highly suppressed in the measurement by a narrow time domain filter supported by superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with low timing jitters and time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) module with high time resolution.

Recently, the hyperentangled Bell state, the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree of freedom, has been used to assist in the complete Bell-state analysis of the four Bell states. However, if the additional degree of freedom is qubitlike, one can only distinguish 7 from the group of 16 states. Here we present a way to distinguish the hyperentangled Bell states completely with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Also, we discuss its application in the quantum teleportation of a particle in an unknown state in two different degrees of freedom and in the entanglement swapping of hyperentangled states. These applications will increase the channel capacity of long-distance quantum communication.},

abstract = {Aluminum nitride and silicon nitride have recently emerged as important nonlinear optical materials in integrated photonics respectively for their quadratic and cubic optical nonlinearity. A composite aluminum nitride and silicon nitride waveguide structure, if realized, will simultaneously allow highly efficient second and third harmonic generation on the same chip platform and therefore assists 2f-3f self-referenced frequency combs. On-chip third harmonic generation, being a higher order nonlinear optics effect, is more demanding than second harmonic generation due to the large frequency difference between the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies which implies large change of refractive indices and more strigent requirements on phase matching. In this work we demonstrate high-efficiency third harmonic generation in a high Q composite aluminum nitride / silicon nitide ring cavity. By carefully engineering the microring resonator geometry of the bilayer structure to optimize the quality factor, mode volume and modal overlap of the optical fields, we report a maximum conversion efficiency of {\$}180\backslash{\%}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}W{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {The advent of laser cooling techniques revolutionized the study of many atomic-scale systems. This has fueled progress towards quantum computers by preparing trapped ions in their motional ground state, and generating new states of matter by achieving Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic vapors. Analogous cooling techniques provide a general and flexible method for preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state, bringing the powerful technology of micromechanics into the quantum regime. Cavity opto- or electro-mechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong interaction between light and motion. However, entering the quantum regime, less than a single quantum of motion, has been elusive because sideband cooling has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of mechanical systems to their hot environments. Here, we demonstrate sideband cooling of the motion of a micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. Entering the quantum regime requires a large electromechanical interaction, which is achieved by embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant circuit. In order to verify the cooling of the membrane motion into the quantum regime, we perform a near quantum-limited measurement of the microwave field, resolving this motion a factor of 5.1 from the Heisenberg limit. Furthermore, our device exhibits strong-coupling allowing coherent exchange of microwave photons and mechanical phonons. Simultaneously achieving strong coupling, ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion, possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger size and mass.},

abstract = {Topological photonics is a rapidly emerging field of research in which geometrical and topological ideas are exploited to design and control the behavior of light. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit QED. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

abstract = {Entanglement--one of the most delicate phenomena in nature--is an essential resource for quantum information applications. Large entangled cluster states have been predicted to enable universal quantum computation, with the required single- qubit measurements readily implemented with photons. Useful large-scale systems must generate and control qubit entanglement on-chip, where quantum information is naturally encoded in photon path. Here we report a silicon photonic chip which integrates resonant-enhanced sources, filters, and reconfigurable optics to generate a path-entangled two-qubit state--the smallest non-trivial cluster state--and analyse its entanglement. We show that ring-resonator-based spontaneous four-wave mixing sources can be made highly indistinguishable, despite their nonlinear dynamics, and the first evidence that their frequency correlations are small, as predicted. We use quantum state tomography, and the strict Bell-CHSH inequality to quantify entanglement in the device, confirming its high performance. This work integrates essential components for building devices and systems to harness quantum entanglement on the large scale.},

abstract = {In this work we examine loss in ring resonator networks from an operator valued phasor addition approach which considers the multiple transmission and cross coupling paths of a quantum field traversing a ring resonator coupled to one or two external waveguide buses. We demonstrate the consistency of our approach by the preservation of the operator commutation relation of the out-coupled bus mode. We compare our results to those obtained from the conventional quantum Langevin approach which introduces noise operators in addition to the quantum Heisenberg equations in order to preserve commutation relations in the presence of loss. It is shown that the two expressions agree in the neighborhood of a cavity resonance where the Langevin approach is applicable, whereas the operator valued phasor addition expression we derive is more general, remaining valid far from resonances. In addition, we examine the effects of internal and coupling losses on the Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold discussed in Hach et al. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 043805 (2014)] that generalizes the destructive interference of two incident photons interfering on a 50:50 beam splitter (HOM effect) to the case of an add-drop double bus ring resonator.},

abstract = {Conventional nonlinear spectroscopy uses classical light to detect matter properties through the variation of its response with frequencies or time delays. Quantum light opens up new avenues for spectroscopy by utilizing parameters of the quantum state of light as novel control knobs and through the variation of photon statistics by coupling to matter. We present an intuitive diagrammatic approach for calculating ultrafast spectroscopy signals induced by quantum light, focusing on applications involving entangled photons with nonclassical bandwidth properties - known as "time-energy entanglement". Nonlinear optical signals induced by quantized light fields are expressed using time ordered multipoint correlation functions of superoperators. These are different from Glauber's g- functions for photon counting which use normally ordered products of ordinary operators. Entangled photon pairs are not subjected to the classical Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and spectral resolution. After a brief survey of properties of entangled photon pairs relevant to their spectroscopic applications, different optical signals, and photon counting setups are discussed and illustrated for simple multi-level model systems.},

Relatively complex quantum circuits have already been demonstrated, but few studies acknowledge the pressing need to integrate photon sources and waveguide circuits together on-chip. A key step towards such large-scale quantum technologies is the integration of just two individual photon sources within a waveguide circuit, and the demonstration of high-visibility quantum interference between them. Here, we report a silicon-on-insulator device combining two four-wave mixing sources, in an interferometer with a reconfigurable phase shifter. We configure the device to create and manipulate two-colour (non-degenerate) or same-colour (degenerate), path-entangled or path-unentangled photon pairs. We observe up to 100.0+/-0.4{\%} visibility quantum interference on-chip, and up to 95+/-4{\%} off-chip.

Here, we report the observation of soliton crystals in monolithic Kerr microresonators - spontaneously and collectively ordered ensembles of co-propagating solitons whose interactions discretize their allowed temporal separations. We unambiguously identify and characterize soliton crystals through analysis of their 'fingerprint' optical spectra, which arise from spectral interference between the solitons. We identify a rich space of soliton crystals exhibiting crystallographic defects and we perform time-domain measurements to directly confirm our inference of their crystal structure. Soliton crystallization is explained by long-range soliton interactions mediated by resonator mode degeneracies, and we probe the qualitative difference between soliton crystals and the disorganized soliton liquid that would form in the absence of these interactions. Our work explores the physics of monolithic Kerr resonators in a regime of dense soliton occupation and offers a way to increase the efficiency of Kerr combs. Furthermore, the extreme degeneracy of the configuration space of soliton crystals suggests an implementation for an on-chip optical buffer.},

For a high-order algorithm, it has been reported that the autocorrelation function can be utilized to achieve the sub-Rayleigh feature. However, we find that this sub- Rayleigh feature for the high-order algorithm is limited only to binary objects, and the image will be distorted when a gray object is placed. This property encourages us to find the physics behind the high-order correlation imaging algo- rithm.

Recent years have seen successful applications of these protocols in a variety of well-isolated micro-systems, including microwave photons3 and superconducting qubits4. However, stabilizing the quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a mechanical oscillator, remains very challenging: the main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which places stringent requirements on the timescale in which the statemust bemeasured. Here we describe a position sensor that is capable of resolving the zero-point motion of a solid-state, 4.3-megahertz nanomechanical oscillator in the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a basic requirement for realtime (Markovian) quantum feedback control tasks, such as groundstate preparation.The sensor is based on evanescent optomechanical coupling to a high-Q microcavity5, and achieves an imprecision four orders of magnitude below that at the standard quantum limit for a weak continuous position measurement6-a 100-fold improvement over previous reports7-9-while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product that is within a factor of five of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. As a demonstration of its utility, we use the measurement as an error signal with which to feedback cool the oscillator. Using radiation pressure as an actuator, the oscillator is cold damped10 with high efficiency: from a cryogenic-bath temperature of 4.4 kelvin to an effective value of 1.160.1 millikelvin, corresponding to a mean phonon number of 5.360.6 (that is, a ground-state probability of 16 per cent).Our results set a newbenchmark for the performance of a linear position sensor, and signal the emergence of mechanical oscillators as practical subjects for measurement-based quantum control.},

Moreover, we provide estimations on the effects of statistical fluctuations and suggest that, even for long distance (larger than 100km) QKD, our two-decoy-state protocol can be implemented with only a few hours of experimental data. In conclusion, decoy state quantum key distribution is highly practical.},

abstract = {Topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as {\{}$\backslash$it Non-Abelian anyons{\}}, meaning that they obey {\{}$\backslash$it non-Abelian braiding statistics{\}}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the $\backslash$nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the $\backslash$nu=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

abstract = {Quantum mechanics dictates that the precision of physical measurements must be subject to certain constraints. In the case of inteferometric displacement measurements, these restrictions impose a 'standard quantum limit' (SQL), which optimally balances the precision of a measurement with its unwanted backaction. To go beyond this limit, one must devise more sophisticated measurement techniques, which either 'evade' the backaction of the measurement, or achieve clever cancellation of the unwanted noise at the detector. In the half-century since the SQL was established, systems ranging from LIGO to ultracold atoms and nanomechanical devices have pushed displacement measurements towards this limit, and a variety of sub-SQL techniques have been tested in proof-of-principle experiments. However, to-date, no experimental system has successfully demonstrated an interferometric displacement measurement with sensitivity (including all relevant noise sources: thermal, backaction, and imprecision) below the SQL. Here, we exploit strong quantum correlations in an ultracoherent optomechanical system to demonstrate off-resonant force and displacement sensitivity reaching 1.5dB below the SQL. This achieves an outstanding goal in mechanical quantum sensing, and further enhances the prospects of using such devices for state-of-the-art force sensing applications.},

The biggest challenge to implement boson sampling with a large number of photons has been the lack of reliable single-photon sources. Here we demonstrate a scalable architecture of boson sampling using a solid-state single-photon source with simultaneously high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability. The single photons are time-bin encoded and interfered in an electrically programmable loop-based network. We implement and validate boson sampling with input three and four single photons, and track the dynamical multi-photon evolution inside the circuit. With further refinement of the system efficiency, our approach may be feasible to be scaled up to {\textgreater}20-boson sampling to outperform classical computers, and thus provide experimental evidence against the Extended Church-Turing Thesis.},

We investigate swapping of continuous-variable entanglement in the time-frequency degree of freedom using three-wave mixing in the low-gain regime with the aim of producing heralded biphoton states with high purity and low multipair probability. Heralding is achieved by combining one photon from each of two biphoton sources via sum-frequency generation to create a herald photon. We present a realistic model with pulsed pumps, investigate the effects of resolving the frequency of the herald photon, and find that frequency-resolving measurement of the herald photon is necessary to produce high-purity biphotons.

The heralding photon is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of off-the-shelf Si single-photon detectors; meanwhile, the heralded photon is in the telecom L-band where fiber losses are at a minimum.

abstract = {Single photon-level quantum frequency conversion has recently been demonstrated using silicon nitride microring resonators. The resonance enhancement offered by such systems enables high-efficiency translation of quantum states of light across wide frequency ranges at sub-watt pump powers. Using a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian formalism, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the conversion dynamics in these systems, and show that they are capable of converting single- and multi-photon quantum states. Analytic formulas for the conversion efficiency, spectral conversion probability density, and pump power requirements are derived which are in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. We show that with only modest improvement to the state of the art, efficiencies exceeding 95{\%} are achievable using less than 100 mW of pump power. At the critical driving strength that yields maximum conversion efficiency, the spectral conversion probability density is shown to exhibit a flat-topped peak, indicating a range of insensitivity to the spectrum of a single photon input. Two alternate theoretical approaches are presented to study the conversion dynamics: a dressed mode approach that yields a better intuitive picture of the conversion process, and a study of the temporal dynamics of the participating modes in the resonator, which uncovers a regime of Rabi-like coherent oscillations of single photons between two different frequency modes. This oscillatory regime arises from the strong coupling of distinct frequency modes mediated by coherent pumps.},

abstract = {Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus associated with sporadic outbreaks in human and equid populations in the Western Hemisphere. After the bite of an infected mosquito, the virus initiates a biphasic disease: a peripheral phase with viral replication in lymphoid and myeloid tissues, followed by a neurotropic phase with infection of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, causing neuropathology and in some cases fatal encephalitis. The mechanisms allowing VEE virus to enter the CNS are currently poorly understood. Previous data have shown that the virus gains access to the CNS by infecting olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal mucosa of mice. However, at day 5 after inoculation, the infection of the brain is multifocal, indicating that virus particles are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To better understand the role of the BBB during VEE virus infection, we used a well-characterized mouse model system. Using VEE virus replicon particles (VRP), we modeled the early events of neuroinvasion, showing that the replication of VRP in the nasal mucosa induced the opening of the BBB, allowing peripherally administered VRP to invade the brain. Peripheral VEE virus infection was characterized by a biphasic opening of the BBB. Further, inhibition of BBB opening resulted in a delayed viral neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. Overall, these results suggest that VEE virus initially enters the CNS through the olfactory pathways and initiates viral replication in the brain, which induces the opening of the BBB, allowing a second wave of invading virus from the periphery to enter the brain.},

abstract = {Quantum information processing offers fundamental improvements over classical information processing, such as computing power, secure communication, and high-precision measurements. However, the best way to create practical devices is not yet known. This textbook describes the techniques that are likely to be used in implementing optical quantum information processors. After developing the fundamental concepts in quantum optics and quantum information theory, the book shows how optical systems can be used to build quantum computers according to the most recent ideas. It discusses implementations based on single photons and linear optics, optically controlled atoms and solid-state systems, atomic ensembles, and optical continuous variables. This book is ideal for graduate students beginning research in optical quantum information processing. It presents the most important techniques of the field using worked examples and over 120 exercises.},

abstract = {The maximum operational range of continuous variable quantum key distribution protocols has shown to be improved by employing high-efficiency forward error correction codes. Typically, the secret key rate model for such protocols is modified to account for the non-zero word error rate of such codes. In this paper, we demonstrate that this model is incorrect: Firstly, we show by example that fixed-rate error correction codes, as currently defined, can exhibit efficiencies greater than unity. Secondly, we show that using this secret key model combined with greater than unity efficiency codes, implies that it is possible to achieve a positive secret key over an entanglement breaking channel - an impossible scenario. We then consider the secret key model from a post-selection perspective, and examine the implications for key rate if we constrain the forward error correction codes to operate at low word error rates.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of strongly driven spontaneous four-wave mixing in a lossy integrated microring resonator side-coupled to a channel waveguide. A nonperturbative, analytic solution within the undepleted pump approximation is developed for a cw pump input of arbitrary intensity. In the strongly driven regime self- and cross-phase modulation, as well as multi-pair generation, lead to a rich variety of power-dependent effects; the results are markedly different than in the low power limit. The photon pair generation rate, single photon spectrum, and joint spectral intensity (JSI) distribution are calculated. Splitting of the generated single photon spectrum into a doublet structure associated with both pump detuning and cross-phase modulation is predicted, as well as substantial narrowing of the generated signal and idler bandwidths associated with the onset of optical parametric oscillation at intermediate powers. Both the correlated and uncorrelated contributions to the JSI are calculated, and for sufficient powers the uncorrelated part of the JSI is found to form a quadruplet structure. The pump detuning is found to play a crucial role in all of these phenomena, and a critical detuning is identified which divides the system behaviour into distinct regimes, as well as an optimal detuning strategy which preserves many of the low-power characteristics of the generated photons for arbitrary input power.},

Moreover, the known protocols for constructing reliable quantum computers from unreliable components can be complicated, often requiring many operations to produce a desired transformation3, 4, 5, 7, 8. Here we show how a single techniqueâa generalization of quantum teleportation9âreduces resource requirements for quantum computers and unifies known protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that single quantum bit (qubit) operations, Bell-basis measurements and certain entangled quantum states such as GreenbergerâHorneâZeilinger (GHZ) states10âall of which are within the reach of current technologyâare sufficient to construct a universal quantum computer.

While nanomechanics has been widely applied in solid-state systems, its use in liquid is scantily studied. There it finds unique applications such as biosensing, rheological sensing, and studying fluid dynamics in unexplored regimes. Its use in quantum fluids offers new opportunities in studying fluids at low excitation levels all the way down to the quantum limit and in nano-metric scales reaching the fluid coherence length. Transduction and control of the low-loss excitations also facilitate long-life quantum information storage.

abstract = {Spin-orbit (SO) coupling has led to numerously exciting phenomena in electron systems, for instance, the recently discovered topological insulator. The synthesized SO coupling with ultracold neutral atoms opens a new avenue of quantum simulation, and gives us an opportunity to study SO coupling in bosonic systems. Indeed, SO coupling leads to many new phenomena of boson superfluidity and various condensate phases that spontaneously break different symmetries. A richer structure of symmetry breaking always results in a nontrivial finite-temperature phase diagram. While the thermodynamics of the SO coupled Bose gas at finite temperature is still unknown either in theory or experiment. In this work, we experimentally generate the SO coupling in ultracold Rb-87 gas to explore in a large temperature range and get most key features. We discover a novel phase transition between the stripe ordered phase and the magnetized phase, which is reminiscent of temperature-driven transition from the B phase to the A phase in super- fluid Helium-3 and from spin-density-wave to spin nematic transition in iron pnictide. We also observe that the magnetic phase transition and the Bose condensate transition occur simultaneously as temperature decreases. Our work determines the entire finite-temperature phase diagram of SO coupled Bose gas and further demonstrate the power of quantum simulation.},

These waveguides are optically transparent in a narrow band of frequencies at a pump power of {\$}25 \backslash, \backslashtext{\{}mW{\}}{\$}. Besides this amplification, we translate a {\$}10 \backslash, \backslashtext{\{}GHz{\}}{\$} microwave signal across {\$}1 \backslash, \backslashtext{\{}THz{\}}{\$}. Chapter 5 extends the experimental work of chapter 4 by fabricating a cascade of fully suspended nanowires held by silica anchors. This enhances the mechanical quality factor from {\$}300{\$} to {\$}1000{\$}, enabling the observation of Brillouin amplification exceeding the propagation losses in silicon. The amount of amplification is mostly limited by a rapid drop in acoustic quality as the number of suspensions increases. We propose a mechanism to cancel this inhomogeneous broadening. Chapter 6 looks at the potential of narrow silicon slot waveguides to enhance the optomechanical coupling. For certain dimensions, these waveguides support opto-acoustic modes with an interaction efficiency simulated an order of magnitude above those of single-nanobeam systems.},

abstract = {Recently there has been a remarkable synergy between the technologies of precision laser stabilization and mode-locked ultrafast lasers. This has resulted in control of the frequency spectrum produced by mode-locked lasers, which consists of a regular comb of sharp lines. Thus such a controlled mode-locked laser is a "femtosecond optical frequency comb generator." For a sufficiently broad comb, it is possible to determine the absolute frequencies of all of the comb lines. This ability has revolutionized optical frequency metrology and synthesis. It has also served as the basis for the recent demonstrations of atomic clocks that utilize an optical frequency transition. In addition, it is having an impact on time-domain applications, including synthesis of a single pulse from two independent lasers. In this Colloquium, we first review the frequency-domain description of a mode-locked laser and the connection between the pulse phase and the frequency spectrum in order to provide a basis for understanding how the absolute frequencies can be determined and controlled. Using this understanding, applications in optical frequency metrology and synthesis and optical atomic clocks are discussed. This is followed by a brief overview of how the comb technology is affecting and will affect time-domain experiments.},

We experimentally demonstrate the proof of concept for a scheme to generate on-demand single photons via actively multiplexing several heralded photons probabilistically produced from pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversions (SPDCs). By utilizing a four-photon-pair source, an active feed-forward technique, and an ultrafast single-photon router, we show a fourfold enhancement of the output photon rate. Simultaneously, we maintain the quality of the output single-photon states, confirmed by correlation measurements. We also experimentally verify, via Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, that the router does not affect the indistinguishability of the single photons. Furthermore, we give numerical simulations, which indicate that photons based on multiplexing of four SPDC sources can outperform the heralding based on highly advanced photon-number-resolving detectors. Our results show a route for on-demand single-photon generation and the practical realization of scalable linear optical quantum information processing.},

abstract = {The quest towards the integration of ultra-fast, high-precision optical clocks is reflected in the large number of high-impact papers on the topic published in the last few years. This interest has been catalysed by the impact that high-precision optical frequency combs (OFCs) have had on metrology and spectroscopy in the last decade [1â5]. OFCs are often referred to as optical rulers: their spectra consist of a precise sequence of discrete and equally-spaced spectral lines that represent precise marks in frequency. Their importance was recognised worldwide with the 2005 Nobel Prize being awarded to T.W. H{\"{a}}nsch and J. Hall for their breakthrough in OFC science [5]. They demonstrated that a coherent OFC source with a large spectrum â covering at least one octave â can be stabilised with a self-referenced approach, where the frequency and the phase do not vary and are completely determined by the source physical parameters. These fully stabilised OFCs solved the challenge of directly measuring optical frequencies and are now exploited as the most accurate time references available, ready to replace the current standard for time. Very recent advancements in the fabrication technology of optical micro-cavities [6] are contributing to the development of OFC sources. These efforts may open up the way to realise ultra-fast and stable optical clocks and pulsed sources with extremely high repetition-rates, in the form of compact and integrated devices. Indeed, the fabrication of high-quality factor (high-Q) micro-resonators, capable of dramatically amplifying the optical field, can be considered a photonics breakthrough that has boosted not only the scientific investigation of OFC sources [7â13] but also of optical sensors and compact light modulators [6,14]. In this framework, the demonstration of planar high-Q resonators, compatible with silicon technology [10â14], has opened up a unique opportunity for these devices to provide entirely new capabilities for photonic-integrated technologies. Indeed, it is well acknowledged by the electronics industry that future generations of computer processing chips will inevitably require an extremely high density of copper-based interconnections, significantly increasing the chip power dissipation to beyond practical levels [15â17]; hence, conventional approaches to chip design must undergo radical changes. On-chip optical networks, or optical interconnects, can offer high speed and low energy per-transferred-bit, and micro-resonators are widely seen as a key component to interface the electronic world with photonics. Many information technology industries have recently focused on the development of integrated ring resonators to be employed for electrically-controlled light modulators [14â17], greatly advancing the maturity of micro-resonator technology as a whole. Recently [11â13], the demonstration of OFC sources in micro-resonators fabricated in electronic (i.e. in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)) compatible platforms has given micro-cavities an additional appeal, with the possibility of exploiting them as light sources in microchips. This scenario is creating fierce competition in developing highly efficient OFC generators based on micro-cavities which can radically change the nature of information transport and processing. Even in telecommunications, perhaps a more conventional environment for optical technologies, novel time-division multiplexed optical systems will require extremely stable optical clocks at ultra-high pulse repetition-rates towards the THz scale. Furthermore, arbitrary pulse generators based on OFC [18,19] are seen as one of the most promising solutions for this next generation of high-capacity optical coherent communication systems. This review will summarise the recent exciting achievements in the field of micro-combs, namely optical frequency combs based on high-Q micro-resonators, with a perspective on both the potential of this technology, as well as the open questions and challenges that remain.},

Although there have been many studies on the measurement of OAM modes, it is difficult to quantitatively and instantaneously measure the power distribution among different OAM modes, let alone measure the phase distribution among them. In this work, we propose an OAM complex spectrum analyzer that enables simultaneous measurements of the power and phase distributions of OAM modes by employing the rotational Doppler effect. The original OAM mode distribution is mapped to an electrical spectrum of beat signals using a photodetector. The power and phase distributions of superimposed OAM beams are successfully retrieved by analyzing the electrical spectrum. We also extend the measurement technique to other spatial modes, such as linear polarization modes. These results represent a new landmark in spatial mode analysis and show great potential for applications in OAM-based systems and optical communication systems with mode-division multiplexing.},

abstract = {An algorithmic proof that any discrete finite-dimensional unitary operator can be constructed in the laboratory using optical devices is given. Our recursive algorithm factorizes any X x N unitary matrix into a sequence of two-dimensional beam splitter transformations. The experiment is built from the corresponding devices. This also permits the measurement of the observable corresponding to any discrete Hermitian matrix. Thus optical experiments with any type of radiation (photons, atoms, etc.) exploring higher-dimensional discrete quantum systems become feasible. PACS numbers: 42.50.Wm, 03.65.Bz, 42.79.Sz, 42.79.Ta While it is evident that any lossless experimental setup can be described by a unitary operator, the inverse problem , i.e. , the question as to whether an experimental setup exists for any given unitary operator, has been a hitherto unsettled question. In the present I etter, we present a surprisingly simple but general algorithm for the design of an experimental realization of any N x N unitary matrix in the laboratory. This, to our knowledge, is the first constructive proof that any discrete unitary operator can be given operational meaning in the real world. Our experimental realization transforms the N input states into the N output states using an arrangement of beam splitters, phase shifters, and mirrors. It should be mentioned that it does not matter what kind of field such an optical multiport is acting upon. {\%}e choose photons here for convenience of discussion and because of the fact that high power sources, even for entangled radiation, are available today. Yet we note that it would be equally possible to realize multiports for electrons, neutrons, atoms, or any other type of radiation. Before going into the details of our proof, we mention that our observation makes a wealth of new experiments possible. Such multistate devices will be used in future quantum computation and quantum information processing schemes. N-state systems of two and more particles permit the study of novel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations in higher dimensions [1], which will find practical applications in quantum cryptography using more than two states [2] and in quantum "teleportation" [3]. Going beyond the simple U(2) interferometer allows the construction of optical experiments equivalent to generalized Stern-Gerlach experiments [4] that can be used to study nontrivial properties of spin-one systems [5] and of higher-dimensional spin systems. A multiport can also be used to simulate general spin systems in Bell inequality experiments [6]. Experiments with entangled photons in multidimen-sional Hilbert spaces have become possible using multi-port beam splitters [7]. Such higher-dimensional discrete quantum systems show effects which are not observable in simple two-dimensional systems and which are of qualitatively completely different nature as has been shown by Gleason, Bell, Kochen, and Specker [8]. Finally, mul-tiports will generalize the apparatus of the fine experiment by Noh, Fougeres, and Mandel [9] to higher dimensions. Thus multiports open the definition and exploration of generalized multimode intensities (including quadratures, Q functions, and P functions) [10,11] and phases to experimental investigation. Independent of and important beyond all practical applications , our observation addresses an old fundamental question in the theory of measurement [12]. This is the question of whether or not an experiment measuring the variable corresponding to any arbitrary Hermitian operator exists. We answer that an analog embodiment using particle beams (photons, neutrons, atoms, etc.) does exist for every Hermitian operator in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. The experimental realization of the most general element of U(2) is well known [13,14]. The matrix of a lossless beam splitter with a phase shifter at one output port will be used in our proof. It transforms the input state with modes (kt, k2) into the output state with mode{\~{}} (kl k2) (1) {\&} kt {\&} e'{\~{}}sinn e'{\~{}}cosa l kt (k2) cos{\&}-slncd) k2 The parameter a describes the reflectivity (v B = sinn) and transmittance (v T = cosa) of the beam splitter. The parameter P can be realized as an external phase shifter after the beam splitter. Phases at the input ports can be chosen so that the beam splitter matrix performs any transformation in U(2) [15,16]. A hearn splitter with variable reHectivity can be substituted by a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using symmetric 50:50 beam splitters (see Fig. 1). We now come to our constructive proof.

Recently, the application of quantum features to metrology has attracted much attention. Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT), which utilizes two-photon interference between entangled photon pairs, is a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence tomography (OCT): As the resolution of OCT becomes higher, degradation of the resolution due to dispersion within the medium becomes more critical. Here we report on the realization of 0.54 $\mu$m resolution two-photon interference, which surpasses the current record resolution 0.75 $\mu$m of low-coherence interference for OCT. In addition, the resolution for QOCT showed almost no change against the dispersion of a 1 mm thickness of water inserted in the optical path, whereas the resolution for OCT dramatically degrades. For this experiment, a highly-efficient chirped quasi-phase-matched lithium tantalate device was developed using a novel 'nano-electrode-poling' technique. The results presented here represent a breakthrough for the realization of quantum protocols, including QOCT, quantum clock synchronization, and more.

The challenge is twofold: first, overcoming noise that limits the precision given a fixed amount of a resource, N, and second, improving the scaling of precision over the standard quantum limit (SQL), 1/$\backslash$sqrt{\{}N{\}}, and ultimately reaching a Heisenberg scaling (HS), 1/N. Here we present and experimentally implement a new scheme for precision measurements. Our scheme is based on a probe in a mixed state with a large uncertainty, combined with a post-selection of an additional pure system, such that the precision of the estimated coupling strength between the probe and the system is enhanced. We performed a measurement of a single photon's Kerr non-linearity with an HS, where an ultra-small Kerr phase of around 6 *10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}} rad was observed with an unprecedented precision of around 3.6* 10{\^{}}{\{}-10{\}} rad. Moreover, our scheme utilizes an imaginary weak-value, the Kerr non-linearity results in a shift of the mean photon number of the probe, and hence, the scheme is robust to noise originating from the self-phase modulation.},

abstract = {One of the most striking phenomena in condensed-matter physics is the quantum Hall effect, which arises in two-dimensional electron systems subject to a large magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons reside. In such circumstances, current is carried by electrons along the edges of the system, in so-called chiral edge states (CESs). These are states that, as a consequence of nontrivial topological properties of the bulk electronic band structure, have a unique directionality and are robust against scattering from disorder. Recently, it was theoretically predicted that electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states could be observed in photonic crystals, which are materials having refractive-index variations with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through them. Here we report the experimental realization and observation of such electromagnetic CESs in a magneto-optical photonic crystal fabricated in the microwave regime. We demonstrate that, like their electronic counterparts, electromagnetic CESs can travel in only one direction and are very robust against scattering from disorder; we find that even large metallic scatterers placed in the path of the propagating edge modes do not induce reflections. These modes may enable the production of new classes of electromagnetic device and experiments that would be impossible using conventional reciprocal photonic states alone. Furthermore, our experimental demonstration and study of photonic CESs provides strong support for the generalization and application of topological band theories to classical and bosonic systems, and may lead to the realization and observation of topological phenomena in a generally much more controlled and customizable fashion than is typically possible with electronic systems.},

The conditional current cumulants that are significantly different from their unconditional counterparts can provide additional information and insight into the electron transport properties of mesoscopic nanostructure systems. The efficient method we develop for calculating the conditional counting statistics is numerically stable, and is capable of calculating the conditional counting statistics for a more complex system than the maximum eigenvalue method and for a wider range of parameters than the quantum trajectory method. We apply our method to investigate how the QPC shot noise affects the conditional counting statistics of the SQD system, going beyond the treatment and parameter regime studied in the literature. We also investigate the case when the interdot coherent coupling is comparable to the dephasing rate caused by the back action of the QPC in the DQD system, in which there is considerable discrepancy in the calculated conditional current cumulants between the population rate (master-) equation approach of sequential tunneling and the full quantum master-equation approach of coherent tunneling.},

abstract = {Light with helical phase structures, carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM), has many applications in both classical and quantum optics, such as high-capacity optical communications and quantum information processing. Frequency conversion is a basic technique to expand the frequency range of the fundamental light. The frequency conversion of OAM-carrying light gives rise to new physics and applications such as up-conversion detection of images and generation of high dimensional OAM entanglements. Quasi-phase matching (QPM) nonlinear crystals are good candidates for frequency conversion, particularly due to their high-valued effective nonlinear coefficients and no walk-off effect. Here we report the first experimental second-harmonic generation (SHG) of an OAM-carried light with a QPM crystal, where a UV light with OAM of 100â is generated. OAM conservation is verified using a specially designed interferometer. With a pump beam carrying an OAM superposition of opposite sign, we observe interesting interference phenomena in the SHG light; specifically, a photonics gear-like structure is obtained that gives direct evidence of OAM conservation, which will be very useful for ultra-sensitive angular measurements. Besides, we also develop a theory to reveal the underlying physics of the phenomena. The methods and theoretical analysis shown here are also applicable to other frequency conversion processes, such as sum frequency generation and difference-frequency generation, and may also be generalized to the quantum regime for single photons.},

abstract = {The quantum nature of an oscillating mechanical object is anything but apparent. The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have a well defined energy, but are quantum superpositions of equally spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different energy eigenstates using resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency. For photons, such dispersive measurements have been performed in cavity1,2 and circuit quantum electrodynamics3. Here we report an experiment in which an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts that are about five times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest experimental improvements, we expect that our approach will enable quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons4 and will lead to quantum sensors and information-processing approaches5 that use chip-scale nanomechanical devices.},

We compare the effects of this phonon sideband in three commonly investigated gate-defined quantum dot material systems: InAs nanowires and GaAs and Si two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). We compare our theory with existing experimental data from cavity-coupled InAs nanowire and GaAs 2DEG double quantum dots and find quantitative agreement only when the phonon sideband and photoemission processes during lead tunneling are taken into account. Finally we show that the phonon sideband also leads to a sizable renormalization of the cavity frequency, which allows for direct spectroscopic probes of the electron-phonon coupling in these systems.},

Until now, coherent manipulations of exciton qubits in semiconductor quantum dots have been performed predominantly by pulsed laser fields. Coherent control of the population of excitonic states with a single laser pulse, observed by Rabi oscillations, has been demonstrated by several groups using different techniques1, 2, 3. By using two laser pulses, more general state control can be achieved4, and coupling of two excitons has been reported5, 6. Here, we present a conceptually new approach for implementing the coherent control of an exciton two-level system (qubit) by means of a time-dependent electric interaction. The new scheme makes use of an optical clock signal and a synchronous electric gate signal, which controls the coherent manipulation.},

abstract = {The optical frequency comb technology is one of the most important breakthrough in photonics in recent years. This concept has revolutionized the science of ultra-stable lightwave and microwave signal generation. These combs were originally generated using ultrafast mode-locked lasers, but in the past decade, a simple and elegant alternativewas proposed,which consisted in pumping an ultra-high-Q optical resonator with Kerr nonlinearity using a continuous-wave laser. When optimal conditions are met, the intracavity pump photons are redistributed via four-wave mixing to the neighboring cavity modes, thereby creating the so-called Kerr optical frequency comb. Beyond being energy-efficient, conceptually simple, and structurally robust, Kerr comb generators are very compact devices (millimetric down to micrometric size) which can be integrated on a chip. They are, therefore, considered as very promising candidates to replace femtosecond mode-locked lasers for the generation of broadband and coherent optical frequency combs in the spectral domain, or equivalently, narrow optical pulses in the temporal domain. These combs are, moreover, expected to provide breakthroughs in many technological areas, such as integrated photonics, metrology, optical telecommunications, and aerospace engineering. The purpose of this review article is to present a comprehensive survey of the topic of Kerr optical frequency combs.We provide an overview of the main theoretical and experimental results that have been obtained so far. We also highlight the potential of Kerr combs for current or prospective applications, and discuss as well some of the open challenges that are to be met at the fundamental and applied level.},

When more than two particles are involved, the situation becomes more complex and interference capability extends beyond pairwise distinguishability, taking on a surprisingly rich character. Here, we study many-particle interference using three photons. We show that the distinguishability between pairs of photons is not sufficient to fully describe the photons' behaviour in a scattering process, but that a collective phase, the triad phase, plays a role. We are able to explore the full parameter space of three-photon interference by generating heralded single photons and interfering them in a fibre tritter. Using multiple degrees of freedom - temporal delays and polarisation - we isolate three-photon interference from two-photon interference. Our experiment disproves the view that pairwise two-photon distinguishability uniquely determines the degree of non-classical many-particle interference.},

Further evidence on the origin of the RL is provided by the NEXAFS spectra from nitrogen-implanted Si and Si3N4films bombarded with Ar+ions. The RL can be annealed out after annealing at temperatures higher than the growth temperature. We propose that the annealing of the RL is due to formation of Si - N bonds, where the Si atoms are provided by the stressed interface. The velocity of the annealing process is controlled by the diffusivity of Si interstitials in the Si3N4and the process is characterized by an activation energy of 0.86 eV.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd. We propose a novel scheme of optical confinement for atoms by using a concave grating reflector. The two-dimension grating structure with a concave surface shape exhibits strong focusing ability under radially polarized illumination. Especially, the light intensity at the focal point is about 100 times higher than that of the incident light. Such a focusing optical field reflected from the curved grating structure can provide a deep potential to trap cold atoms. We discuss the feasibility of the structure serving as an optical dipole trap. Our results are as follows. (i) Van der Waals attraction potential to the surface of the structure has a low effect on trapped atoms. (ii) The maximum trapping potential is â¼ 1.14 mK in the optical trap, which is high enough to trap cold  87 Rb atoms from a standard magneto-optical trap with a temperature of 120 $\mu$K, and the maximum photon scattering rate is lower than 1/s. (iii) Such a microtrap array can also manipulate and control cold molecules, or microscopic particles.},

Specifically, the realization of high-dimensional states (D-level quantum systems, that is, qudits, with D {\textgreater} 2) and their control are necessary for fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics 2 , for increasing the sensitivity of quantum imaging schemes 3 , for improving the robustness and key rate of quantum communication protocols 4 , for enabling a richer variety of quantum simulations 5 , and for achieving more efficient and error-tolerant quantum computation 6 . Integrated photonics has recently become a leading platform for the compact, cost-efficient, and stable generation and processing of non-classical optical states 7 . However, so far, integrated entangled quantum sources have been limited to qubits (D = 2) 8â11 . Here we demonstrate on-chip generation of entangled qudit states, where the photons are created in a coherent superposition of multiple high-purity frequency modes. In particular, we confirm the realization of a quantum system with at least one hundred dimensions, formed by two entangled qudits with D = 10. Furthermore, using state-of-the-art, yet off-the-shelf telecommunications components, we introduce a coherent manipulation platform with which to control frequency-entangled states, capable of performing deterministic high-dimensional gate operations. We validate this platform by measuring Bell inequality violations and performing quantum state tomography. Our work enables the generation and processing of high-dimensional quantum states in a single spatial mode. Integrated photonics makes use of the well developed semiconductor industry to fabricate optical waveguides and functional devices on compact and mass-producible chips 12 , which are increasingly being used to realize stable, low-cost and practical components for optical quantum systems 7 . Among the many such on-chip optical quantum sources are devices emitting single photons 13 , as well as entangled two-photon states making use of the polarization 8,9 , spatial 10,14 , or temporal 11,15 degree of freedom. Large-scale quantum states, which are necessary for meaningful quantum information processing, for example, can be achieved by increasing the number of entangled photons and/or their dimensionality 16 . Recently the on-chip generation of two-dimensional four-photon entangled states was demonstrated 17 . However, this approach is limited in that the detection rate of multi-photon states fundamentally diminishes with an increasing number of photons, in turn reducing the information processing performance 16 . Remarkably, the use of higher-dimensional states enables the amount of quantum information to be increased without reducing the detection rate 16 .

abstract = {A novel class of optical waveguides with a box-shaped cross section consisting of a low-index inner material surrounded by a thin high-index coating layer is presented. This original multilayered structure widens the traditional concept of index contrast for dielectric waveguides toward a more general concept of effective index contrast, which can be artificially tailored over a continuous range by properly choosing the thickness of the outer high-index layers. An electromagnetic analysis is reported, which shows that the transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes are spatially confined in different regions of the cross section and exhibit an almost 90Â° rotational symmetry. Such unusual field distribution is demonstrated to open the way to new intriguing properties with respect to conventional waveguides. Design criteria are provided into details, which mainly focus on the polarization dependence of the waveguide on geometrical parameters. The possibility of achieving single-mode waveguides with either zero or high birefringence is discussed, and the bending capabilities are compared to conventional waveguides. The feasibility of the proposed waveguide is demonstrated by the realization of prototypal samples that are fabricated by using the emerging CMOS-compatible Si3N4-SiO2TriPleX technology. An exhaustiveexperimental characterization is reported, which shows propagation loss as low as state-of-the-art low-index-contrast waveguides ({\textless} 0.1 dB/cm) together with enhanced flexibility in the optimization of polarization sensitivity and confirms the high potentialities of the proposed waveguides for large-scale integrated optics. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Highly integrated quantum photonic chips on silicon and related platforms have been demonstrated incorporating only one or two of these basic building blocks. Previous implementations of all three components were mainly limited by laser stray light, making temporal filtering necessary or required complex manipulation to transfer all components onto one chip. So far, a monolithic, simultaneous implementation of all elements demonstrating single-photon operation remains elusive.

We measure the joint spectral intensity distribution and second order correlation functions of the marginal beams and find with both methods very low effective mode numbers corresponding to a Schmidt number below 1.16. We further demonstrate the indistinguishability as well as the purity of signal and idler photons by Hong-Ou-Mandel interferences between signal and idler and between signal/idler and a coherent field, respectively. Without using narrowband spectral filtering, we achieve a visibility for the interference between signal and idler of 94.8{\%} and determine a purity of more than 80{\%} for the heralded single photon states. Moreover, we measure raw heralding efficiencies of 20.5{\%} and 15.5{\%} for the signal and idler beams corresponding to detector-loss corrected values of 80{\%} and 70{\%}.},

This method severely limits the usefulness of the resulting entangled states. Here, we show the direct production of polarization-entangled photon triplets by cascading two entangled downconversion processes. Detecting the triplets with high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors allows us to fully characterize them through quantum state tomography. We use our three-photon entangled state to demonstrate the ability to herald Bell states, a task that was not possible with previous three-photon states, and test local realism by violating the Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities. These results represent a significant breakthrough for entangled multi-photon state production by eliminating the constraints of outcome post-selection, providing a novel resource for optical quantum information processing.},

abstract = {We assess the overall performance of our quantum key distribution (QKD) system implementing the measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocol using components with varying capabilities such as different single photon detectors and qubit preparation hardware. We experimentally show that superconducting nanowire single photon detectors allow QKD over a channel featuring 60 dB loss, and QKD with more than 600 bits of secret key per second (not considering finite key effects) over a 16 dB loss channel. This corresponds to 300 km and 80 km of standard telecommunication fiber, respectively. We also demonstrate that the integration of our QKD system into FPGA-based hardware (instead of state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators) does not impact on its performance. Our investigation allows us to acquire an improved understanding of the trade-offs between complexity, cost and system performance, which is required for future customization of MDI-QKD. Given that our system can be operated outside the laboratory over deployed fiber, we conclude that MDI-QKD is a promising approach to information-theoretic secure key distribution.},

It displays a broad transparency window spanning from the visible to the mid-IR and waveguides can be manufactured with low losses. An absence of nonlinear multi-photon absorption in the erbium lightwave communications band has enabled various nonlinear optic applications in the past decade. Silicon nitride is a dielectric material whose optical and mechanical properties strongly depend on the deposition conditions. In particular, the optical bandgap can be modified with the gas flow ratio during low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Here we show that this parameter can be controlled in a highly reproducible manner, providing an approach to synthesize the nonlinear Kerr coefficient of the material. This holistic empirical study provides relevant guidelines to optimize the properties of LPCVD silicon nitride waveguides for nonlinear optics applications that rely on the Kerr effect.},

A central goal has been to integrate photon-resolving detectors to reduce optical losses, latency, and wiring complexity associated with off-chip detectors. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are particularly attractive because of high detection efficiency, sub-50-ps timing jitter, nanosecond-scale reset time, and sensitivity from the visible to the mid-infrared spectrum. However, while single SNSPDs have been incorporated into individual waveguides, the system efficiency of multiple SNSPDs in one photonic circuit has been limited below 0.2{\%} due to low device yield. Here we introduce a micrometer-scale flip-chip process that enables scalable integration of SNSPDs on a range of PICs. Ten low-jitter detectors were integrated on one PIC with 100{\%} device yield. With an average system efficiency beyond 10{\%} for multiple SNSPDs on one PIC, we demonstrate high-fidelity on-chip photon correlation measurements of non-classical light.},

Stoichiometric amorphous Si3N4 possesses the same local structure as crystalline Si3N4, with Si being fourfold coordinated and N being threefold coordinated. Only few Si-Si and N-N bonds and other defects are found in stoichiometric silicon nitride, and the electronic properties are very similar to the crystalline bulk. In over-stoichiometric Si3N4+x, the additional N results in N-N bonds, whereas in under-stoichiometric Si3N4-x the number of homopolar Si-Si bonds increases with decreasing N content. Analysis of the structure factor and the local coordination of the Si atoms indicates a slight tendency towards Si clustering, although at the investigated stoichiometries, phase separation is not observed. In the electronic properties, the conduction-band minimum is dominated by Si states, whereas the valence-band maximum is made up by lone pair N states. Towards Si rich samples, the character of the valence-band maximum becomes dominated by Si states corresponding to Si-Si bonding linear combinations. Adding small amounts of hydrogen, as typically used in passivating layers of photovoltaic devices, has essentially no impact on the overall structural and electronic properties. ? 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Solitons are waveforms that preserve their shape while propagating, as a result of a balance of dispersion and nonlinearity. Soliton-based data transmission schemes were investigated in the 1980s and showed promise as a way of overcoming the limitations imposed by dispersion of optical fibres. However, these approaches were later abandoned in favour of wavelength-division multiplexing schemes, which are easier to implement and offer improved scalability to higher data rates. Here we show that solitons could make a comeback in optical communications, not as a competitor but as a key element of massively parallel wavelength-division multiplexing. Instead of encoding data on the soliton pulse train itself, we use continuous-wave tones of the associated frequency comb as carriers for communication. Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) (solitons that rely on a double balance of parametric gain and cavity loss, as well as dispersion and nonlinearity) are generated as continuously circulating pulses in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator via four-photon interactions mediated by the Kerr nonlinearity, leading to low-noise, spectrally smooth, broadband optical frequency combs. We use two interleaved DKS frequency combs to transmit a data stream of more than 50 terabits per second on 179 individual optical carriers that span the entire telecommunication C and L bands (centred around infrared telecommunication wavelengths of 1.55 micrometres). We also demonstrate coherent detection of a wavelength-division multiplexing data stream by using a pair of DKS frequency combs-one as a multi-wavelength light source at the transmitter and the other as the corresponding local oscillator at the receiver. This approach exploits the scalability of microresonator-based DKS frequency comb sources for massively parallel optical communications at both the transmitter and the receiver. Our results demonstrate the potential of these sources to replace the arrays of continuous-wave lasers that are currently used in high-speed communications. In combination with advanced spatial multiplexing schemes and highly integrated silicon photonic circuits, DKS frequency combs could bring chip-scale petabit-per-second transceivers into reach.},

abstract = {To increase dramatically the distance and the secure key generation rate of quantum key distribution (QKD), the idea of quantum decoys--signals of different intensities--has recently been proposed. Here, we present the first experimental implementation of decoy state QKD. By making simple modifications to a commercial quantum key distribution system, we show that a secure key generation rate of 165bit/s, which is 1/4 of the theoretical limit, can be obtained over 15km of a Telecom fiber. We also show that with the same experimental parameters, not even a single bit of secure key can be extracted with a non-decoy-state protocol. Compared to building single photon sources, decoy state QKD is a much simpler method for increasing the distance and key generation rate of unconditionally secure QKD.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of synchronization occurs universally across the natural sciences and provides critical insight into the behavior of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems. It also offers a powerful approach to robust frequency or temporal locking in diverse applications including communications, superconductors, and photonics. Here we report the experimental synchronization of two coupled soliton modelocked chip-based frequency combs separated over distances of 20 m. We show that such a system obeys the universal Kuramoto model for synchronization and that the cavity solitons from the microresonators can be coherently combined which overcomes the fundamental power limit of microresonator-based combs. This study could significantly expand applications of microresonator combs, and with its capability for massive integration, offers a chip-based photonic platform for exploring complex nonlinear systems.},

Dispersion of dual-slot silicon waveguide is mainly determined by mode transition from a strip mode to a slot mode rather than by material dispersion. Dispersion tailoring is investigated by tuning different structural parameters of waveguides. Moreover, nonlinear coefficient of dual-slot silicon waveguide and phase-matching condition in FWM are both explored in detail. The dual-slot waveguide can be used to generate supercontinuum with bandwidth extending up to 1630 nm pumped by femtosecond pulses. This waveguide will have a great potential for ultrabroadband signal processing applications from near-infrared region to mid-infrared region.},

Each signal sent out is entangled with an ancilla, which is retained. Detection takes place via an entangling measurement on the returning signal together with the ancilla. This paper shows that for photodetection, quantum illumination with m bits of entanglement can in principle increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2(m), an exponential improvement over unentangled illumination. The enhancement persists even when noise and loss are so great that no entanglement survives at the detector.},

abstract = {We demonstrate indirect photonic transitions in a silicon slow light photonic crystal waveguide. The transitions are driven by an optically generated refractive index front that moves along the waveguide and interacts with a signal pulse copropagating in the structure. We experimentally confirm a theoretical model which indicates that the ratio of the frequency and wave vector shifts associated with the indirect photonic transition is identical to the propagation velocity of the refractive index front. The physical origin of the transitions achieved here is fundamentally different than in previously proposed refractive index modulation concepts with fixed temporal and spatial modulation frequencies; as here, the interaction with the refractive index front results in a Doppler-like signal frequency and wave vector shift. Consequently, the bandwidth over which perfect mode frequency and wave vector matching is achieved is not intrinsically limited by the shape of the photonic bands, and tuning of the indirect photonic transitions is possible without any need for geometrical modifications of the structure. Our device is genuinely nonreciprocal, as it provides different frequency shifts for co- and counterpropagating signal and index fronts. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Although signal multiplexing and demultiplexing are equally important, traditional multiplexing and demultiplexing methods are based on passive devices such as arrayed waveguides and fiber Bragg cascade filters, which, although widely used in commercial devices, lack any active tuning ability. In this work, we propose a signal demultiplexing method based on sum frequency generation (SFG) with two significant features: first, any signal from the common communication channel can be demultiplexed to a single user by switching the pump wavelength; second, a cheap high-performance detector can be used for signal detection. These two features were demonstrated by demultiplexing multi-channel energy-time entanglement generated by a micro-cavity silicon chip. High interference visibilities over three channels after demultiplexing showed that entanglement was preserved and verified the high performance of the demultiplexer, which will find wide application in high-capacity quantum communication networks.},

abstract = {Engineering strong interactions between optical photons is a great challenge for quantum science. Envisioned applications range from the realization of photonic gates for quantum information processing to synthesis of photonic quantum materials for investigation of strongly-correlated driven-dissipative systems. Polaritonics, based on the strong coupling of photons to atomic or electronic excitations in an optical resonator, has emerged as a promising approach to implement those tasks. Recent experiments demonstrated the onset of quantum correlations in the exciton-polariton system, showing that strong polariton blockade could be achieved if interactions were an order of magnitude stronger. Here, we report time resolved four-wave mixing experiments on a two-dimensional electron system embedded in an optical cavity, demonstrating that polariton-polariton interactions are strongly enhanced when the electrons are initially in a fractional quantum Hall state. Our experiments indicate that in addition to strong correlations in the electronic ground state, exciton-electron interactions leading to the formation of polaron polaritons play a key role in enhancing the nonlinear optical response. Besides potential applications in realization of strongly interacting photonic systems, our findings suggest that nonlinear optical measurements could provide information about fractional quantum Hall states that is not accessible in linear optical response.},

We observed a nearly two-fold decrease in the two-photon absorption coefficient from 0.76 cm/GW at 300K to 0.42 cm/GW at 5.5 K.

abstract = {We present and discuss perspectives of current developments on advanced quantum optical circuits monolithically integrated in the lithium niobate platform. A set of basic components comprising photon pair sources based on parametric down conversion (PDC), passive routing elements and active electro-optically controllable switches and polarisation converters are building blocks of a toolbox which is the basis for a broad range of diverse quantum circuits. We review the state-of-the-art of these components and provide models that properly describe their performance in quantum circuits. As an example for applications of these models we discuss design issues for a circuit providing on-chip two-photon interference. The circuit comprises a PDC section for photon pair generation followed by an actively controllable modified Mach-Zehnder structure for observing Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference. The performance of such a chip is simulated theoretically by taking even imperfections of the properties of the individual components into account.},

abstract = {How to remove detector side channel attacks has been a notoriously hard problem in quantum cryptography. Here, we propose a simple solution to this problem-measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD). It not only removes all detector side channels, but also doubles the secure distance with conventional lasers. Our proposal can be implemented with standard optical components with low detection efficiency and highly lossy channels. In contrast to the previous solution of full device independent QKD, the realization of our idea does not require detectors of near unity detection efficiency in combination with a qubit amplifier (based on teleportation) or a quantum nondemolition measurement of the number of photons in a pulse. Furthermore, its key generation rate is many orders of magnitude higher than that based on full device independent QKD. The results show that long-distance quantum cryptography over say 200km will remain secure even with seriously flawed detectors. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

By operating near the synchronism point (where the phase velocities of the individual waveguides are equal), we can cause the optical power to be confined to any of the two waveguides. This is accomplished by control of waveguides' geometry. In the portion of the supermode resonator where amplification takes place, the mode is confined nearly completely to III-V guide thus realizing a near maximal gain. Near the output facet, the mode power is confined to the Si waveguide thus optimizing the output coupling. This is to be contrasted with approaches which depend on evanescent field penetration into the III-V medium to obtain gain.},

In particular, the first generation of large-scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors have passed through their life cycle, meanwhile reaching the sensitivity level close to zero-point oscillations amplitude of their kilogram-scale probe masses and bounded by quantum phase fluctuations of light over a substantial fraction of the sensitivity band. In parallel, a series of successful experiments with small-scale mechanical resonators interacting with an electromagnetic (optical or microwave) field has been performed, aimed at preparation of these mechanical resonators in a pure quantum state or observation of their motion at a quantum sensitivity level.These experiments rely on the most advanced experimental technologies available now. At the same time, the basic ideas behind them: the linear quantum meter, the standard quantum limit, and the optical rigidity were conceived almost half a century ago in the late sixties and seventies of the previous century and were developed since then in context of the gravitational wave detectors [first the solid state (bar) and later the laser interferometric ones].In this review, we seek to provide a systematic description of both the main theoretical principles of quantum optomechanics and of the recent experimental achievements in this area.},

To address experiment design, we study the impact on spectral separability of realistic (sech shaped and chirped) pump fields, realistic nonlinear crystals with fabrication imperfections, and undesirable PDC generation far from the central PMF peak coming from nonlinearity shaping methods. To address experiment characterization, we study the effect of discretization and spectral range of the measured bi-photon joint spectrum, the difference between inferring separability from the joint spectral amplitude vs. the joint spectral intensity, and advantages of interference experiments for purity characterization over methods based on the joint spectral intensity. This study will be of practical interest to researchers building the next generation of nonlinear sources of separable photon pairs.},

Here we study the influence of the microresonator mode spectrum on temporal soliton formation in a crystalline MgF2 microresonator. While an overall anomalous group velocity dispersion is required, it is found that higher order dispersion can be tolerated as long as it does not dominate the resonator's mode structure. Avoided mode crossings induced by linear mode coupling in the resonator mode spectrum are found to prevent soliton formation when affecting resonator modes close to the pump laser frequency. The experimental observations are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations based on the nonlinear coupled mode equations. The presented results provide for the first time design criteria for the generation of temporal solitons in optical microresonators.},

The new class of Kerr-frequency comb sources, based on parametric frequency conversion in optical microresonators, can complement conventional systems in applications requiring high repetition rates such as direct comb spectroscopy, spectrometer calibration, arbitrary optical waveform generation and advanced telecommunications. However, a severe limitation in experiments working towards practical systems is phase noise, observed in the form of linewidth broadening, multiple repetition-rate beat notes and loss of temporal coherence. These phenomena are not explained by the current theory of Kerr comb formation, yet understanding this is crucial to the maturation of Kerr comb technology. Here, based on observations in crystalline MgF2 and planar Si 3N4 microresonators, we reveal the universal, platform-independent dynamics of Kerr comb formation, allowing the explanation of a wide range of phenomena not previously understood, as well as identifying the condition for, and transition to, low-phase-noise performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we demonstrate the first integrated optomechanical single-photon frequency shifter with near-unity efficiency. A frequency shift up to 150 â¬...GHz at telecom wavelength is realized without measurable added noise and the preservation of quantum coherence is verified through quantum interference between twin photons of different colours.

In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a scheme for long distance QGI utilizing frequency correlated photon pairs. In this scheme, the frequency correlation is transformed to the correlation between the illuminating position of one photon and the arrival time of the other photon, by which QGI can be realized in the time domain. Since frequency correlation can be preserved when the photon pairs are distributed over optical fibers, this scheme provides a way to realize long-distance QGI over large geographical scale. In the experiment, long distance QGI over 50 km optical fibers has been demonstrated.},

abstract = {The wave-particle duality dates back to Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect through quanta of light and de Broglie's hypothesis of matter waves. Quantum mechanics uses an abstract description for the behavior of physical systems such as photons, electrons, or atoms. Whether quantum predictions for single systems in an interferometric experiment allow an intuitive understanding in terms of the particle or wave picture, depends on the specific configuration which is being used. In principle, this leaves open the possibility that quantum systems always either behave definitely as a particle or definitely as a wave in every experimental run by a priori adapting to the specific experimental situation. This is precisely what is tried to be excluded by delayed-choice experiments, in which the observer chooses to reveal the particle or wave character -- or even a continuous transformation between the two -- of a quantum system at a late stage of the experiment. We review the history of delayed-choice gedanken experiments, which can be traced back to the early days of quantum mechanics. Then we discuss their experimental realizations, in particular Wheeler's delayed choice in interferometric setups as well as delayed-choice quantum erasure and entanglement swapping. The latter is particularly interesting, because it elevates the wave-particle duality of a single quantum system to an entanglement-separability duality of multiple systems.},

abstract = {Quantum theory predicts that entanglement can also persist in macroscopic physical systems, albeit difficulties to demonstrate it experimentally remain. Recently, significant progress has been achieved and genuine entanglement between up to 2900 atoms was reported. Here we demonstrate 16 million genuinely entangled atoms in a solid-state quantum memory prepared by the heralded absorption of a single photon. We develop an entanglement witness for quantifying the number of genuinely entangled particles based on the collective effect of directed emission combined with the nonclassical nature of the emitted light. The method is applicable to a wide range of physical systems and is effective even in situations with significant losses. Our results clarify the role of multipartite entanglement in ensemble-based quantum memories as a necessary prerequisite to achieve a high single-photon process fidelity crucial for future quantum networks. On a more fundamental level, our results reveal the robustness of certain classes of multipartite entangled states, contrary to, e.g., Schr$\backslash$"odinger-cat states, and that the depth of entanglement can be experimentally certified at unprecedented scales.},

abstract = {Efficient second harmonic generation in integrated platforms is usually achieved by resonant structures, intermodal phase-matching or quasi-phase matching by periodically poling ferroelectric waveguides. However, in all these structures, it is impossible to reconfigure the phase-matching condition in an all-optical way. Here, we demonstrate that a Watt-level laser causes a periodic modification of the second-order susceptibility in a silicon nitride waveguide, allowing for quasi-phase-matching between the pump and second harmonic modes for arbitrary wavelengths inside the erbium band. The grating is long-term inscribed, and leads to a second harmonic generation enhancement of more than 30 dB. We estimate a $\chi$ (2) on the order of 0.3 pm/V, with a maximum conversion efficiency of 0.05{\%} Wâ1. We explain the observed phenomenon with the coherent photogalvanic effect model, which correctly agrees with the retrieved experimental parameters.},

The resonators are used to measure both the thermal and ultrafast Kerr nonlinearities.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Kerr nonlinearity-based frequency combs and solitons have been generated from on-chip microresonators. The initiation of the combs requires global or local anomalous dispersion which leads to many limitations, such as material choice, film thickness, and spectral ranges where combs can be generated, as well as fabrication challenges. Using a concentric racetrack-shaped resonator, we show that such constraints can be lifted and resonator dispersion can be engineered to be anomalous over moderately broad bandwidth. We demonstrate anomalous dispersion in a 300 nm thick silicon nitride film, suitable for semiconductor manufacturing but previously thought to result in waveguides with high normal dispersion. Together with a mode-selective, tapered coupling scheme, we generate coherent mode-locked frequency combs. Our method can realize anomalous dispersion for resonators at almost any wavelength and simultaneously achieve material and process compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing.},

abstract = {We show that a strong mode-interaction in microcavities can trigger single soliton Kerr combs deterministically. The soliton number tends to be reduced to 1 to decrease the nonlinear loss into mode-interaction induced Cherenkov radiation. OCIS codes: (190.5530) Pulse propagation and temporal solitons; (190.4390) Nonlinear optics, integrated optics. Soliton formation in microresonators provides an important way to generate chip-scale frequency combs [1]. Generating a smooth and phase coherent comb spectrum is critical for many applications, e.g., optical arbitrary waveform generation, spectroscopy and optical communications. For this purpose, single cavity soliton generation is favored, compared to multi-soliton combs. However, the random nature of the soliton generation process usually leads to multiple-solitons instead of a single soliton [1]. To generate single solitons, many experimental methods have been proposed and used, including: fast and precise control of the laser scan speed [1, 2], backward tuning [3], active capture [4], and phase/amplitude modulation of the pump [5]. Most of these techniques require relatively complicated active control; it is desirable to discover passive mechanisms that can induce single soliton generation. Here we introduce such a passive mechanism arising from mode-interaction that induces single soliton generation deterministically. Furthermore, our numerical results reveal that the interplay between the soliton and the mode-interaction induced Cherenkov radiation (CR, also termed as dispersive wave) greatly affects the stability of a multi-soliton state [7]. Cavity solitons are generated in silicon nitride (SiN) microresonators. In the experiments, we investigate soliton generation in two similar SiN microresonators with the same geometry design (2000 nm Ã 800 nm), the same radius (100 $\mu$m), and similar Q-factor (loaded Q: 2.4Ã10 6 for Device 1, 3.0Ã10 6 for Device 2). Due to small nano-fabrication imperfections, the two devices can exhibit distinct mode-interaction strengths. We first use linear transmission spectroscopy to measure the relative resonance frequencies $\nu$ m -$\nu$ 0 -md 1 for different modes m ($\nu$ 0 is the resonance frequency for the pumped mode, d 1 is the free-spectral-range). From the measurement, we can see that the resonance frequency shift from mode-interaction for Device 1 is much larger than for Device 2 (Fig. 1(a)). Fig. 1 Soliton generation in two similar devices. (a) The linear transmission spectroscopy shows that the Device 1 has a much stronger mode-interaction than Device 2. (b) Histogram plot of 40 overlaid converted comb power traces for Device 1, when scanning the laser across the resonance. The color density represents the counts of a certain power level occurring during the given time slot. Soliton-step comprising a single soliton is observed in all 40 scans.

The quantum light propagates freely and reaches a remote receiver for quantum state tomography.

Silicon-based platforms have been prolific amongst the suite of advanced nonlinear optical signal processes demonstrated to date. These include crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, Hydex glass, and stoichiometric silicon nitride. Residing between stoichiometric silicon nitride and amorphous silicon in composition, silicon-rich nitride films of various formulations have emerged recently as promising nonlinear platforms for high nonlinear figure of merit nonlinear optics. Silicon-rich nitride films are compositionally engineered to create bandgaps that are sufficiently large to eliminate two-photon absorption at telecommunications wavelengths while enabling much larger nonlinear waveguide parameters (5xâ500x) than those in stoichiometric silicon nitride.

Multipartite quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for such a network and hence it is imperative to study the possibility of verifying a multipartite entanglement source in a way that is efficient and provides strong guarantees even in the presence of multiple dishonest parties. In this work, we show how an agent of a quantum network can perform a distributed verification of a multipartite entangled source with minimal resources, which is, nevertheless, resistant against any number of dishonest parties. Moreover, we provide a tight tradeoff between the level of security and the distance between the state produced by the source and the ideal maximally entangled state. Last, by adding the resource of a trusted common random source, we can further provide security guarantees for all honest parties in the quantum network simultaneously.},

Still, the presence of decoherence hinders significantly the performance of quantum-enhanced protocols. In this review, we summarize the developments of quantum metrology with particular focus on optical interferometry and derive fundamental bounds on achievable quantum-enhanced precision in optical interferometry taking into account the most relevant decoherence processes including: phase diffusion, losses, and imperfect interferometric visibility. We introduce all the necessary tools of quantum optics as well as quantum estimation theory required to derive the bounds. We also discuss the practical attainability of the bounds derived and stress, in particular, that the techniques of quantum-enhanced interferometry which are being implemented in modern gravitational-wave detectors are close to the optimal ones.},

Rutherford backscattering measurements indicated that a silicon nitride structure Si3Nx (x {\textgreater} 5) with excess nitrogen could be prepared with the SWP-CVD method under high NH3/SiH4 source gas ratio conditions. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) analysis provided verification that the excess nitrogen combined with the oxygen contained in the SiNx film during low-temperature film formation and that the atomic ratio of Si and N was almost stoichiometric, i.e., Si3N4. XPS study also revealed that the Si3N{\textless} 4 structure contained suboxides, which presence may reduce the transparency of the films. In contrast, suboxides were not observed in the Si3N4 structure obtained under high NH3/SiH4 source gas ratio conditions. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study confirmed that the SiNx film becomes more stable when the SiNx structure approaches the stoichiometric ratio. Achieving a near-transparent Si3N4 structure requires a sufficient amount of N atoms in the periphery of the Si atom, i.e., an adequate amount of NH3 is necessary in the presence of the SiH4.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Optical Society of America. Optical resonators with high quality factors (Qs) are promising for a variety of applications due to the enhanced nonlinearity and increased photonic density of states at resonances. In particular,frequency combs (FCs) can be generated through four-wave mixing in high-Q microresonators made from Kerr nonlinear materials such as silica,silicon nitride,magnesium fluoride,and calcium fluoride. These devices have potential for on-chip frequency metrology and high-resolution spectroscopy,high-bandwidth radiofrequency information processing,and high-data-rate telecommunications. Silicon nitride microresonators are attractive due to their compatibility with integrated circuit manufacturing; they can be cladded with silica for long-term stable yet tunable operation,and allow multiple resonators to be coupled together to achieve novel functionalities. Despite previous demonstrations of high-Q silicon nitride resonators,FC generation using silicon nitride microresonator chips still requires pump power significantly higher than those in whispering gallery mode resonators made from silica,magnesium,and calcium fluorides,which all have shown resonator Qs between 0.1 and 100 billion. Here,we report on a fabrication procedure that leads to the demonstration of "finger-shaped" Si 3 N 4  microresonators with intrinsic Qs up to 17 million at a free spectrum range (FSR) of 24.7 GHz that are suitable for telecommunication and microwave photonics applications. The frequency comb onset power can be as low as 2.36 mW and broad,single FSR combs can be generated at a low pump power of 24 mW,both within reach of on-chip semiconductor lasers. Our demonstration is an important step toward a fully integrated on-chip FC source.},

To boost these technologies, a race is currently ongoing to increase the number of particles in multiparticle entangled states, such as GreenbergerâHorneâZeilinger (GHZ) states. An alternative route is to increase the number of entangled quantum levels. Here, we overcome present experimental and technological challenges to create a three-particle GHZ state entangled in three levels for every particle. The resulting qutrit-entangled states are able to carry more information than entangled states of qubits. Our method, inspired by the computer algorithm Melvin, relies on a new multi-port that coherently manipulates several photons simultaneously in higher dimensions. The realization required us to develop a new high-brightness four-photon source entangled in orbital angular momentum. Our results allow qualitatively new refutations of local-realistic world views. We also expect that they will open up pathways for a further boost to quantum technologies.},

Typical experiments employ sources of photon pairs generated by parametric processes such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave-mixing. The standard characterization of these sources relies on detecting the pairs themselves and thus requires single photon detectors, which limit both measurement speed and accuracy. Here it is shown that the two-photon quantum state that would be generated by parametric fluorescence can be characterised with unprecedented spectral resolution by performing a classical experiment. This streamlined technique gives access to hitherto unexplored features of two-photon states and has the potential to speed up design and testing of massively parallel integrated nonlinear sources by providing a fast and reliable quality control procedure. Additionally, it allows for the engineering of quantum light states at a significantly higher level of spectral detail, powering future quantum optical applications based on time-energy photon correlations.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrated the Brillouin scattering induced transparency (BSIT) in a high quality optical microresonantor. Benefited from the triple-resonance in the whispering gallery cavity, the photon-phonon interaction is enhanced, and enables the light storage to the phonon, which has lifetime up to 10us. In addition, due to the phase matching condition, the stored circulating acoustic phonon can only interact with certain direction light, which leads to non-reciprocal light storage and retrieval.

abstract = {In this thesis, we investigated nonlinear frequency conversion of optical wavelengths using integrated silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides. Two nonlinear conversion schemes were considered: seeded four-wave mixing and supercontinuum generation. The firstâseeded four-wave mixingâis investigated by a numerical study and proposed as light source for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). The compatibility of the silicon nitride-based integrated waveguide with microfluidic channels enables potential applications for on-chip CARS spectroscopy. Both four-wave mixing and supercontinuum generation require waveguides with a large core area to obtain the dispersion required for phase-matched nonlinear frequency conversion. A novel fabrication technique for manufacturing large-core Si3N4 waveguides was investigated. The main advantage of this novel technique is the ability to manufacture crack-free Si3N4 waveguides with sufficient thickness to phase match nonlinear optical processes, while simultaneously realizing a high device yield. To demonstrate that such waveguides can be dispersion engineered and, i.e., allow for phase matching for nonlinear frequency conversion, we experimentally investigated supercontinuum generation in these waveguides using two different pump wavelengths. For a pump wavelength of 1560 nm, the waveguide was dispersion engineered to have a zero-dispersion wavelength just above 1600 nm, such that the pump wavelength experiences anomalous dispersion. The generated supercontinuum spanned more than 700 nm (at -30 dB), limited by the available pump energy. Theoretical modeling showed an exceptionally good agreement with the measured spectrum, and that an octave-spanning supercontinuum is possible if the pump energy is increased. The pulse-to-pulse coherence was calculated for this case and we found that the supercontinuum was fully coherent over its bandwidth (-30 dB), showing that Si3N4 waveguides could be used to generate an optical frequency comb. For a pump wavelength of 1064 nm, the waveguide was designed to have a zero-dispersion wavelength just below 1000 nm to have, again, anomalous dispersion for the pump wavelength. At this pump wavelength, the generated supercontinuum spanned an ultrabroad-bandwidth of nearly 500 THz covering nearly the whole transparency window of Si3N4/SiO2 waveguides.},

abstract = {Quantum information processing is the emerging field that defines and realizes computing devices that make use of quantum mechanical principles, like the superposition principle, entanglement, and interference. In this review we study the information counterpart of computing. The abstract form of the distributed computing setting is called communication complexity. It studies the amount of information, in terms of bits or in our case qubits, that two spatially separated computing devices need to exchange in order to perform some computational task. Surprisingly, quantum mechanics can be used to obtain dramatic advantages for such tasks. We review the area of quantum communication complexity, and show how it connects the foundational physics questions regarding non-locality with those of communication complexity studied in theoretical computer science. The first examples exhibiting the advantage of the use of qubits in distributed information-processing tasks were based on non-locality tests. However, by now the field has produced strong and interesting quantum protocols and algorithms of its own that demonstrate that entanglement, although it cannot be used to replace communication, can be used to reduce the communication exponentially. In turn, these new advances yield a new outlook on the foundations of physics, and could even yield new proposals for experiments that test the foundations of physics.},

abstract = {Photon pair sources are fundamental building blocks for quantum entanglement and quantum communication. Recent studies in silicon photonics have documented promising characteristics for photon pair sources within the telecommunications band, including sub-milliwatt optical pump power, high spectral brightness, and high photon purity. However, most quantum systems suitable for local operations, such as storage and computation, support optical transitions in the visible or short near-infrared bands. In comparison to telecommunications wavelengths, the significantly higher optical attenuation in silica at such wavelengths limits the length scale over which optical-fiber-based quantum communication between such local nodes can take place. One approach to connect such systems over fiber is through a photon pair source that can bridge the visible and telecom bands, but an appropriate source, which should produce narrow-band photon pairs with a high signal-to-noise ratio, has not yet been developed in an integrated platform. Here, we demonstrate a nanophotonic visible-telecom photon pair source for the first time, using high quality factor silicon nitride resonators to generate bright photon pairs with an unprecedented coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) up to (3800 +/- 200). We further demonstrate dispersion engineering of the microresonators to enable the connection of different species of trapped atoms/ions, defect centers, and quantum dots to the telecommunications bands for future quantum communication systems.},

This strong form of security, unattainable with standard schemes, is possible only when using correlations that violate a Bell inequality. We provide a general security proof valid for a large class of device-independent quantum key distribution protocols in a model in which the raw key elements are generated by causally independent measurement processes. The validity of this independence condition may be justifiable in a variety of implementations and is necessarily satisfied in a physical realization where the raw key is generated by N separate pairs of devices. Our work shows that device-independent quantum key distribution is possible with key rates comparable to those of standard schemes.},

abstract = {Single self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots are promising bright sources of indistinguishable photons for quantum information science. However, their distribution in emission wavelength, due to inhomogeneous broadening inherent to their growth, has limited the ability to create multiple identical sources. Quantum frequency conversion can overcome this issue, particularly if implemented using scalable chip-integrated technologies. Here, we report the first demonstration of quantum frequency conversion of a quantum dot single-photon source on a silicon nanophotonic chip. Single photons from a quantum dot in a micropillar cavity are shifted in wavelength with an on-chip conversion efficiency of approximately 12 {\%}, limited by the linewidth of the quantum dot photons. The intensity autocorrelation function g(2)(tau) for the frequency-converted light is antibunched with g(2)(0) = 0.290 +/- 0.030, compared to the before-conversion value g(2)(0) = 0.080 +/- 0.003. We demonstrate the suitability of our frequency conversion interface as a resource for quantum dot sources by characterizing its effectiveness across a wide span of input wavelengths (840 nm to 980 nm), and its ability to achieve tunable wavelength shifts difficult to obtain by other approaches.},

abstract = {Boson sampling is considered as a strong candidate to demonstrate 'quantum computational supremacy' over classical computers. However, previous proof-of-principle experiments suffered from small photon number and low sampling rates owing to the inefficiencies of the single-photon sources and multiport optical interferometers. Here, we develop two central components for high-performance boson sampling: robust multiphoton interferometers with 99{\%} transmission rate and actively demultiplexed single-photon sources based on a quantum dotâmicropillar with simultaneously high efficiency, purity and indistinguishability. We implement and validate three-, four-and five-photon boson sampling, and achieve sampling rates of 4.96 kHz, 151 Hz and 4 Hz, respectively, which are over 24,000 times faster than previous experiments. Our architecture can be scaled up for a larger number of photons and with higher sampling rates to compete with classical computers, and might provide experimental evidence against the extended ChurchâTuring thesis. Q uantum computers 1 can, in principle, solve certain problems faster than classical computers. Despite substantial progress in the past two decades 2â4 , building quantum machines that can actually outperform classical computers for some specific tasks âan important milestone termed 'quantum supremacy'âremains challenging. In the quest of demonstrating quantum supremacy, boson sampling, an intermediate (that is, non-universal) quantum computer model proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov 5 , has received considerable interest as it requires fewer physical resources than building universal optical quantum computers 6 . A quantum boson-sampling machine can be realized by sending n indistinguishable single photons through a passive m-mode (m {\textgreater} n) interferometer, and sampling from the probabilis-tic output distribution. Mathematically, the probability amplitude of each output outcome is proportional to the permanent of a corre-sponding n Ã n submatrix, which is strongly believed to be intract-able because calculating the permanent is a so-called {\#}P-complete problem. Note that, however, boson sampling is itself not a {\#}P-complete problem, that is, the matrix permanent cannot be efficiently calculated. For a specifically defined task of sampling over the entire distribution, it is expected that a sufficiently large quantum boson-sampling machine cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers 5,7,8 . In principle, a large-scale boson-sampling machine would constitute an effective disproof against a foundational tenet in computer science: the extended ChurchâTuring thesis, which postulates that all realistic physical systems can be efficiently simulated with a (classical) probabilistic Turing machine. To this end, an experimental roadmap for demonstrating quantum supremacy is to construct multiphoton boson-sampling machines with increasing number of input photons and faster sampling rates to compete with classical computers. However, the overall performance of previous proof-of-principle boson-sampling experiments 9â17 was limited due to the lack of high-quality single-photon sources and low-loss multimode circuits. For example, the most commonly used pseudo-single photons created using spontaneous parametric down-conversion 18 (SPDC) were intrinsi-cally probabilistic and mixed with multiphoton components. The SPDC probability was kept low (about a few per cent) to suppress the unwanted two-photon emission. The frequency correlation of the SPDC photon pairs and the inefficient collection into single-mode fibres further reduced the single-photon heralding efficiency to typically a low level of â¼1{\%} in previous work},

abstract = {We develop a scheme for generating a universal qubit cluster state using probabilistic Bell measurements without the need for feed-forward or long-time quantum memories. Borrowing ideas from percolation theory we numerically show that using unambiguous Bell measurements that succeed with 75{\%} success probability, one could build a cluster state with an underlying pyrochlore geometry such that the probability of having a spanning cluster in a chosen direction approaches unity in the limit of an infinite lattice size. The initial resources required for the generation of a universal state in our protocol are 3-qubit cluster states that are within experimental reach and are a minimal resource for a Bell-measurement-based percolation proposal. Since single and multi-photon losses can be detected in Bell measurements, our protocol raises the prospect of a fully error-robust scheme.},

The QKD system is capable of continuous and autonomous operation and uses the coherent one-way (COW) protocol. This system brings together three key concepts for future QKD systems: a simple high-speed protocol; high performance detection; and integration, both at the component level as well for connectivity with standard fibre networks. Here, we show laboratory and field trial results for this system. The full prototype version uses InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and was laboratory tested up to 150km, with a 10-hour exchange averaging around 2kbps of real-time distilled secret bits over 100km. In the field trials, we obtained average distribution rates, during 3 hours, of 2.5bps over a 43dB-loss line of 150km, when using superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs).},

Our realization of 2D SO coupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a broad avenue in cold atoms to study exotic quantum phases, including the highly-sought-after topological superfluid phases.},

Here, we present the design of a new integrated optics architecture with an effective size of 25 mm ï¿½ 2 mm ï¿½ 1 mm. Our objective is to obtain an ultraflat microoptics QKD add-on suitable for integration into handheld platforms such as smartphones. In this context, we evaluated the suitability of various optical subsystems. We tested an array of four vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) with highly similar emission properties capable of producing subnanosecond near-infrared pulses at 100-MHz repetition rate. As short pulses exhibit a low polarization degree, their polarization can be externally controlled by a micropolarizer array. The fabrication of such elements is quite straightforward using standard lithographic techniques and extinction ratios up to 29 dB have been measured. To guarantee spatial indistinguishability of the qubits, we investigate the option of using low-birefringence, single-mode waveguide array manufactured via femtosecond laser micromachining.},

Subsequent detection of a single scattered Stokes photon projects the macroscopic oscillator into a single-phonon Fock state. The nonclassical nature of this mechanical state can be demonstrated by applying a readout laser on the lower sideband to map the phononic state to a photonic mode and performing an autocorrelation measurement.

For instance, the interaction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting quantum information processing.

abstract = {Quantum information technology strongly relies on coupling of optical photons with narrowband quantum systems, such as quantum dots, color centers, and atomic systems. This coupling requires matching the optical wavelength and bandwidth to the desired system, which presents a considerable problem for most available sources of quantum light. Here we demonstrate coupling of alkali dipole transitions with a tunable source of photon pairs. Our source is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a triply-resonant whispering-gallery mode resonator. For this, we have developed novel wavelength tuning mechanisms, which allow for a coarse tuning to either cesium or rubidium wavelength with subsequent continuous fine-tuning to the desired transition. As a demonstration of the functionality of the source, we performed a heralded single photon measurement of the atomic decay. We present a major advance in controlling the spontaneous down-conversion process, which makes our bright source of single photons now compatible with a plethora of narrow-band resonant systems.},

Here, we realize the opposite scenario and engineer a mechanical oscillator cooled close to its ground state into a cold dissipative reservoir for microwave photons in a superconducting circuit. By tuning the coupling to this dissipative mechanical reservoir, we demonstrate dynamical backaction control of the microwave field, leading to stimulated emission and maser action. Moreover, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum resource, allowing the implementation of a near-quantum-limited phase-preserving microwave amplifier. Such engineered mechanical dissipation extends the toolbox of quantum manipulation techniques of the microwave field and constitutes a new ingredient for optomechanical protocols.},

We show that a hybrid system consisting of a piezoelectric mechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting cavity may allow to electro-mechanically generate measurable photons from vacuum, intrinsically associated to the dynamical Casimir effect. Such an experiment may be achieved with current technology, based on film bulk acoustic resonators directly coupled to a superconducting cavity.

Here, we show dephasing-free two-photon entanglement from an Indium rich single quantum dot comprising of nuclear spin 9/2 when excited quasi-resonantly. This remarkable finding is based on a perfect match between our entanglement measurements with our model that assumes no dephasing and takes into account the detection system's timing jitter and dark counts. We discover that neglecting the detection system is responsible for not reaching perfect entanglement in the past and not the nuclear spins. Therefore, the key to unity entanglement from quantum dots comprises of a resonant excitation scheme and a detection system with ultra-low timing jitter and dark counts.},

While nonreciprocal devices based on magnetic effects are available for free-space and fibre-optic communication systems, their on-chip integration has been challenging, primarily due to the concomitant high insertion loss, weak magneto-optical effects, and material incompatibility. We show that Kerr nonlinear resonators can be used to achieve all-passive, low-loss, bias-free, broadband nonreciprocal transmission and routing for applications in photonic systems such as chip-scale LIDAR. A multi-port nonlinear Fano resonator is used as an on-chip, all-optical router for frequency comb based distance measurement. Since time-reversal symmetry imposes stringent limitations on the operating power range and transmission of a single nonlinear resonator, we implement a cascaded Fano-Lorentzian resonator system that overcomes these limitations and significantly improves the insertion loss, bandwidth and non-reciprocal power range of current state-of-the-art devices.

abstract = {Non-classical states of light, such as entangled photon pairs and number states, are essential for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and optical quantum technologies. The most widespread technique for creating these quantum resources is the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of laser light into photon pairs. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known as phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations which are used to produce two-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom. It has been a longstanding goal of the quantum optics community to realise a source that can produce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches considered, none have been technically feasible. In this paper we report the observation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Here each triplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum correlations will extend over all three photons in a way not achievable with independently created photon pairs. We expect our photon-triplet source to open up new avenues of quantum optics and become an important tool in quantum technologies. Our source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum correlations, the post-selection free generation of tripartite entanglement without post- selection and the generation of heralded entangled-photon pairs suitable for linear optical quantum computing. Two of the triplet photons have a wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, ideally suited for three-party quantum communication. Furthermore, our results open interesting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous down-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant to optical quantum computing.},

The use of three-qubit gates may simplify the structure of quantum circuits dramatically. Among them, the controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) gates are essential since they can be directly applied to important protocols, e.g., error correction, fingerprinting, and optimal cloning. Here we report a realization of the Fredkin gate for photonic qubits. We achieve a fidelity of 0.85 in the computational basis and an output state fidelity of 0.81 for a 3-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. The estimated process fidelity of 0.77 indicates that our Fredkin gate can be applied to various quantum tasks.},

abstract = {Single-photon sources have recently been demonstrated using a variety of devices, including molecules, mesoscopic quantum wells, colour centres, trapped ions and semiconductor quantum dots. Compared with a Poisson-distributed source of the same intensity, these sources rarely emit two or more photons in the same pulse. Numerous applications for single-photon sources have been proposed in the field of quantum information, but most--including linear-optical quantum computation--also require consecutive photons to have identical wave packets. For a source based on a single quantum emitter, the emitter must therefore be excited in a rapid or deterministic way, and interact little with its surrounding environment. Here we test the indistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor quantum dot in a microcavity through a Hong-Ou-Mandel-type two-photon interference experiment. We find that consecutive photons are largely indistinguishable, with a mean wave-packet overlap as large as 0.81, making this source useful in a variety of experiments in quantum optics and quantum information.},

abstract = {The formation of temporal dissipative solitons in continuous wave laser driven microresonators enables the generation of coherent, broadband and spectrally smooth optical frequency combs as well as femtosecond pulses with compact form factor. Here we report for the first time on the observation of a Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift for a microresonator soliton. The Raman effect manifests itself in amorphous SiN microresonator based single soliton states by a spectrum that is hyperbolic secant in shape, but whose center is spectrally red-shifted (i.e. offset) from the continuous wave pump laser. The Raman induced spectral red-shift is found to be tunable via the pump laser detuning and grows linearly with peak power. The shift is theoretically described by the first order shock term of the material's Raman response, and we infer a Raman shock time of 20 fs for amorphous SiN. Moreover, we observe that the Raman induced frequency shift can lead to a cancellation or overcompensation of the soliton recoil caused by the formation of a (coherent) dispersive wave. The observations are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) with a Raman shock term. Our results contribute to the understanding of Kerr frequency combs in the soliton regime, enable to substantially improve the accuracy of modeling and are relevant to the fundamental timing jitter of microresonator solitons.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE. Dispersion engineering is important in integrated photonics with a high index contrast. We present an exploration of the parameter space in dispersion-engineered silicon multilayer waveguides, based on a strip/slot hybrid waveguide structure. The relationship between low-dispersion bandwidth and dispersion variation is extensively investigated under different index contrasts between silicon and slot material and various structural parameter sets. Our results show that with a refractive index ranging from 1.4 to 2.9, any real material can be used in combination with silicon for dispersion flattening in principle, as long as device fabrication technologies allow. This paper provides a general guideline for future designs of dispersion-flattened silicon waveguides. Ultrawide low dispersion with a dispersion variation of around Â±35 ps/(nm{\textperiodcentered}km) can be obtained over a 2000-nm wavelength range, from the near-infrared to the mid-infrared.},

We show that MgF 2 is limited by multiphonon absorption by studying the temperature dependence of the Q factor. In contrast, in SrF2 and BaF2 the lower multiphonon absorption leads to ultra-high Q factors at 4.5 $\mu$m.

One beam passes through the object to a bucket (single-pixel) detector, while the second beam's spatial profile is measured by a high resolution (multi-pixel) detector but never interacts with the object. Neither detector can reconstruct the image independently. However, until now ghost imaging has only been demonstrated with photons. Here we report the first realisation of ghost imaging of an object using massive particles. In our experiment, the two beams are formed by correlated pairs of ultracold metastable helium atoms, originating from two colliding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) via {\$}s{\$}-wave scattering. We use the higher-order Kapitza-Dirac effect to generate the large number of correlated atom pairs required, enabling the creation of a ghost image with good visibility and sub-millimetre resolution. Future extensions could include ghost interference as well as tests of EPR entantlement and Bell's inequalities.},

Group IV photonics hold great potential for nonlinear applications in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) wavelength ranges, exhibiting strong nonlinearities in bulk materials, high index contrast, CMOS compatibility, and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we review our recent numerical work on various types of silicon and germanium waveguides for octave-spanning ultrafast nonlinear applications. We discuss the material properties of silicon, silicon nitride, silicon nano-crystals, silica, germanium, and chalcogenide glasses including arsenic sulfide and arsenic selenide to use them for waveguide core, cladding and slot layer. The waveguides are analyzed and improved for four spectrum ranges from visible, near-IR to mid-IR, with material dispersion given by Sellmeier equations and wavelength-dependent nonlinear Kerr index taken into account. Broadband dispersion engineering is emphasized as a critical approach to achieving on-chip octavespanning nonlinear functions. These include octave-wide supercontinuum generation, ultrashort pulse compression to sub-cycle level, and mode-locked Kerr frequency comb generation based on few-cycle cavity solitons, which are potentially useful for next-generation optical communications, signal processing, imaging and sensing applications.},

abstract = {In this article, we use quantum Langevin equations to provide a theoretical understanding of the non-classical behavior of Kerr optical frequency combs when pumped below and above threshold. In the configuration where the system is under threshold, the pump field is the unique oscillating mode inside the resonator, and triggers the phenomenon of spontaneous four-wave mixing, where two photons from the pump are symmetrically up- and down-converted in the Fourier domain. This phenomenon can only be understood and analyzed from a fully quantum perspective as a consequence of the coupling between the field of the central (pumped) mode and the vacuum fluctuations of the various sidemodes. We analytically calculate the power spectra of the spontaneous emission noise, and we show that these spectra can be either single- or double peaked depending on the parameters of the system. We also calculate as well the overall spontaneous noise power per sidemode, and propose simplified analytical expressions for some particular cases. In the configuration where the system is pumped above threshold, we investigate the phenomena of quantum correlations and multimode squeezed states of light that can occur in the Kerr frequency combs originating from stimulated four-wave mixing. We show that for all stationary spatio-temporal patterns, the side-modes that are symmetrical relatively to the pumped mode in the frequency domain display quantum correlations that can lead to squeezed states of light. We also explicitly determine the phase quadratures leading to photon entanglement, and analytically calculate their quantum noise spectra. We finally discuss the relevance of Kerr combs for quantum information systems at optical telecommunication wavelengths, below and above threshold.},

abstract = {Among the objectives toward large-scale quantum computation is the quantum interconnect: a device which uses photons to interface qubits that otherwise could not interact. However, current approaches require photons indistinguishable in frequency---a major challenge for systems experiencing different local environments or of different physical compositions altogether. Here we develop an entirely new platform which actually exploits such frequency mismatch for processing quantum information. Labeled "spectral linear optical quantum computation" (spectral LOQC), our protocol offers favorable linear scaling of optical resources and enjoys an unprecedented degree of parallelism, as an arbitrary {\$}N{\$}-qubit quantum gate may be performed in parallel on multiple {\$}N{\$}-qubit sets in the same linear optical device. Not only does spectral LOQC offer new potential for optical interconnects; it also brings the ubiquitous technology of high-speed fiber optics to bear on photonic quantum information, making wavelength-configurable and robust optical quantum systems within reach.},

We show methods for single-qubit operations and heralded controlled phase (CPhase) gates, providing a sufficient set of operations for universal quantum computing with the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn scheme. Our scheme is suited to available photonic devices and ideally allows arbitrary numbers of qubits to be encoded in the same spatial mode, demonstrating the potential for time-frequency modes to dramatically increase the quantum information capacity of fixed spatial resources. As a test of our scheme, we demonstrate the first entirely single spatial mode implementation of a two-qubit quantum gate and show its operation with an average fidelity of 0.84+-0.07.},

@article{Boggio2014,
abstract = {Dispersion engineering in silicon nitride (SiX NY ) waveguides is investigated through the optimization of the waveguide transversal dimensions and refractive indices in a multi-cladding arrangement. Ultra-flat dispersion of -84.0 +/- 0.5 ps/nm/km between 1700 and 2440 nm and 1.5 +/- 3 ps/nm/km between 1670 and 2500 nm is numerically demonstrated. It is shown that typical refractive index fluctuations as well as dimension fluctuations during the fabrication of the SiX NY waveguides are a limitation for obtaining ultra-flat dispersion profiles. Single- and multi-cladding waveguides are fabricated and their dispersion profiles measured (over nearly 1000 nm) using a low-coherence frequency domain interferometric technique. By appropriate thickness optimization, the zero-dispersion wavelength is tuned over a large spectral range in both single-cladding waveguides and multi-cladding waveguides with small refractive index contrast (3 {\%}). A flat dispersion profile with 3.2 ps/nm/km variation over 500 nm is obtained in a multi-cladding waveguide fabricated with a refractive index contrast of 37 {\%}. Finally, we generate a nearly three-octave supercontinuum in this dispersion flattened multi-cladding SiX NY waveguide.},
